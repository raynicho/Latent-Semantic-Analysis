<div class="bodyHeading">Vintage Computer Games of the Eighties</div>

<p>This is a list of the more memorable games for computers. I am not looking for
  ARCADE GAMES. This list is for games that were strictly for computer users.</p>

<p>This page currently edited by: <b>Gwen</b>.  Past editor: <b>???</b></p><div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">2 on 2 Basketball</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Had two player team and vs. action (as well as single player). First Bball game to allow player adjustments -- post player or shooter, and allowed a certain number of rating points for each. Full court play, although you only really saw one half-court at a time. No press, but popular for its team oriented play. 2 dunk stiles, 3 point shooting, and stats given after the game. Graphics were subpar, but gameplay made up the difference. By Gamestar.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">3D Monster Maze (Sinclair ZX-81)</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Astonishing 3-d game for the beloved Sinclair ZX-81, where you try to escape from a labyrinth where lives a T-Rex. Quite simple, used to scare us to death and probably can be called "the grandfather of 3d games".</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">AD&amp;D Goldbox games</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">TSR and SSI moved to present the official AD&amp;D CRPG to the public.  The Goldbox games include Pool of Radiance, Curse of the Azure Bonds, Secret of the Silver Blades, Pools of Darkness, Champions (Death Knights, Dark Queen) of Krynn, and Gateway (and Treasures) of the Savage Frontier.  Fairly evolved for the time, the Goldbox games offered Diehard AD&amp;D players something to do when they couldn't pull a group together to play</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Adventure Construction Set</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Created by EA, ACS allowed people to design their own adventures and then let other people play them.  It paved the way for many similar games to follow (Bard's Tale Construction set, AD&amp;D Unlimited Adventurers, etc.)</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Agent USA</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">I loved playing this in third grade on the Commodore 64!  You were a little guy, and you had to buy tickets and take trains (regular and express) to different cities.  There would be bad guys around, and you had to somehow collect these diamonds from them.  There were also bad guys that looked like little TV's.  I don't really remember what the object of the game was, but it was awesome!  And the main bad guy was a giant TV.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Airborne Rangers</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Came out around 1988.Sort of similar to "Commando", but with more realism (not that it was realistic either.)  Players went on a variety of missions in various geographic settings. Lots of fun!</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">ALF</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">It was based on the tv show but it was the friends of ALF from Melmac had crash landed and ALF was suppose to pick up pieces lying around to fix the ship. he eat cats running around, and pizzas for power. but u had to watch out for Willie and the DOg Catacher or else they took u away and u would lose and your poor friends were stuck. it was a floppy disk for DOS</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Alice In Wonderland</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Sounds dorky, I know, but this was the most annoying game I have ever played.  Very complex and hard to play it had a difficult interface.  It ran on Apple IIes, but we ran it on a IIc.  It was actually sort of an action game and had a 'donkey kong' like interface.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Alley Cat</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Very pink, you are a cat jumping in and out of windows, garbage cans etc...trying to avoid laundry, other cats etc...</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Alpiner</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">It was from the old texas instrument computer that played cartritges. All you basically did was climb a mountain while avoiding various objects and animals</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Alternate Reality : The City</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">A truely open-ended RPG from the 80s.  It was supposed to be the 1st of 7 but on The City and The Dungeon got released.  I remember mapping out the city on graph paper as I went.  The premise of the game was that you were abducted by aliens and set down in this fantasy city complete with magic, monstaers, and music.  Very addictive and vast in size.  i wish they would remake this one today.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Amazon</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Another Tellarium release, you're lost in the Amazon jungle and have to get home. Release for the C64</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Archon series</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">One of the most popular game series for the commodore system.  The archon series used a combination of strategy and arcade action.  In the original game, players control pieces on a chessboard and fought against opponents in realtime arcade sequence to win the game.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Archon</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">A great chess-like fantasy game for the old C64, pitting the forces of Light against Darkness (or somesuch).  The opening music was absolutely the best.  Anyone who ever played the game will no doubt remember the music.  Archon II was pretty spiffy, too.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Argh</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">It was just a puzzle / strategy game, there were different shaped and different colored pieces and it would tell you before you started where each piece had to go, so then you have only one open space and you have to slide the pieces around in this box until you get the right colored shapes where they're suppose to go. From what I remember, it's not as easy as it sounds.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Artic Fox</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">1st person tank sim shootem up. (ed. was one of the very first first-person shooters available for home computers with a style similar to the arcade game Battlezone).</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Asylum</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">This was a surrealistic first person 3d adventure for the TRS 80. Resplendent in clunky b/w! You start a padded cell in an insane asylum and your mission is to escape. Mad inmates and an even maddening 3d maze kept you hooked for weeks. Best part: the note that tells you to look up...only to have a paino fall on your head! You need to give the axe murderour this note and wait for his musical demise otherwise you get chopped to bits. Despite plenty of first person 3d adverntures today, few match Alsylum's surreal and disturbing milieu, which goes to show increased computer power is not substitute for creativity. There was as sequel boasting such fun as "killer clowns" - priceless.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Atic Atac</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Isometric (fake 3D) game for Spectrum 48k. One of the early  ones that attempted to give a 'dark' look.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Auto Duel</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Created by Lord British &amp; Chuckles of Origin Systems, this was a futuristic pen &amp; paper game that was ported to the computer. Fight in arenas to earn money to buy a tricked-out car, carry loads to different cities, or become a highway bandit and steal loads and sell them on the black market. Release for the C64 &amp; Apple ][</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Autoduel</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Based on the Car Wars RPG by Steve Jackson Games.  A sort of Mad Max-ish future where people strapped weapons to their car for survival.  You could take courier missions, turn vigilante, compete in tournaments or try to ambush anyone who drive by.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Autoduel</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Avoid The Noid</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">PC game that I played on my old IBM PC Jr when I was around four. It involved the famous "noid" character from the Domino's Pizza ads and you had to... avoid him!</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Aztec</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">It's a Commodore 64 game. You are an atzecan soldier and you have to stay alive till the end of the game, because the King whants to know if his pyramidal fortress can protect forever him and his "golden things" after his death: YOU AGAINST THE FORTRESS....</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Aztec</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">This was a great game for the Apple. You went into some Inca pyramid looking for this lost idol. The game was about eight screens by eight screens and you had monsters to knife or shoot or avoid(they grew from snakes and small spiders to dinosaurs and octopi,) and there were plenty of traps like a giant water spigot that would fill the room with water, or even a descending ceiling where the walls on the side slammed shut. Very Indiana Jones, and it also had cool bugs where you could jump through walls if you knew what to do.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Back to the Future</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">There was a Back to the Future game that was played on the Amiga computer. You played as Marty Mcfly on a skateboard and you were riding thru the streets avoiding cars and people to meet up with "Doc". You could punch people on the street which was kinda funny. The game had the main theme from the Back to the Future movie, but the sound was cheesy.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Bad Street Brawler</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">A must have for the commodore 64. You played this pissed off wrestling dude(looked like hulk hogan with sun glasses) who goes around parts of town and performs body slams and wrestling moves on people. It had no plot but lots of cool special effects. Came out in the mid 80's</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Bad Street Brawler</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Ballblazer</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">One of the first titles ever developed by LucasArts (nee LucasFilm Games, back when they were in building 'Z' on the ILM campus).  An astounding furious two-player first-person 3D game with a simple premise:  Get the ball and shoot it into your opponents goal.  Utilizing a horizontally-split screen, you drove a hovercraft over a checkerboard grid, grabbed the ball using your forcefield, then carried it to your opponent's goal, all the while trying to avoid your opponent bumping you, harassing you, and trying to steal the ball.  The hovercraft would automatically orient toward the goal (if you had the ball), or the ball (if you didn't).  Originally developed for the Atari 400/800 systems, it was eventually ported (much) later to the C-64 and other platforms.  (An Amiga port was prototyped but never completed.)</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Barbie</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Barbie got a call from Ken about the date, then you would go shopping to pick out outfits, hair, and all sorts of things.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">The Bard's Tale (and II, III)</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Combination of graphic and text RPG games, Bard's Tale was one of the early users of the 1st person (3D) viewpoint.  Hosting numerous classes, equip, spells, and monsters; Bard's Tale went on to create 2 popular sequels and a construction set.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Batman</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">On the Commodore Amiga (1989) it sold more of that computer than any one pack ever before or after. A seminal mix of styles from driving to platform and puzzle. Superb.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Battle of Britain</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Made by Lucasarts. At the time it was the best WW2 flight sim on the market. It actually worked on an 8mhz XT!</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Battlestoad</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">One of the most deliciously fun and bloody games of it's day. By Marc Goodman (credited as "Mangrove Earthshoe") for the Apple II platform, released in 1982 by Datamost. With an inset bird's eye viewfinder over the wide-open green grass field of combat -- to help you decide which way to run, You, a knight in full armor and with a battle axe for each hand, would seek to destroy enemy knights. A simple game, played entirely from a top-down view, it was you against the world on this little "decapitation island", if you will. With the slight memory-caused delays you'd almost feel the impact as you slammed your axes into the enemy!</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Battlezone</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Best tank game of the eighties, notable for its 3D driver's POV graphics done with simple green lines on a black screen,  and scary sound effects add to the suspense.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">BC's Quest For Tires</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Prehistoric unicycle skill-building at its finest.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Beach Head</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">You play the role of an invading force during WWII, trying to take over an island.  The first game made by Access of Links fame.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Bedlam</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Text adventure game where you try to escape from an insane assylum, and if you didn't bribe other inmates who caught you by giving them cigarettes, they'd call the guards on you.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Beer Run</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">One of the most poorly conceived and designed games for the Apple IIe, Beer Run was also one of the few that established its own devoted cult following (primarily because the title included the word "beer"). The object of the game was to guide your only marginally recognizable stick figure around the screen to collect as many beer cans as possible.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Below The Root</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">A Windham Classic Game where you are a tree dweller and must complete a mission to keep the evil forces from the underworld to take over your friendly villages.  Originally played on a TANDY.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Beyond Castle Wolfenstain</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">The objective of the game is to eliminate Hitler and his high command that are in the bottom of the bunker.  You play the role of a spy.  Have to find and activate the bomb, make your way through the maze avoiding or bribing the guards, finding secret codes, weapons, etc... and find your way out after the bomb explodes.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">the bilestoad</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">I just remember looking at a games magazine when I was 12 and thinking "Whoa! I have to play this!" The name of the game is a play on the words that mean "Axe death" in German. A lot of the game is spent in 2 person axe battles from an over head view - kind of like Activision's boxing with more sophisticated controls and uh, with axes. Good times, good times... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bilestoad</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Blind Driver</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">For the Apple ][. A text-based driving game. Drive as fast as you can, avoid the cops, stop for food and gas (or a bit of gambling), and use nitrous to jump bridges. Back in '83, I think my computer teacher confiscated at least one copy a week (sometimes more!).</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Blockbusters</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">this was the original game that gave you a paddle at the bottom of the screen and bricks on the top for you to break. It's more fun than todays similarities due to the fact that it was so simple and not overbaked.  I can't find it though. No google search as of yet will help me here because of the insane fetish with putting the term blockbuster on everything!</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Blue Max</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Great scrolling 8 bit flight game, WW I pilot trying to blow up targets and ultimately win.  Was greaton Atari 400/800 and C64.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Bolo</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Bomb Jack</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">The player controls Jack, a superhero who can leap and glide. Someone has planted 24 bombs at famous tourist sites (the Sphinx and Great Pyramids, the Acropolis, Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, and two cityscapes resembling Miami Beach and Hollywood, which appear only as screen backgrounds rather than unique game locations). Jack must fly around the screen to collect the bombs before a timer runs out. Each screen uses a different configuration of platforms upon which Jack may run on, or jump from, or remain at rest. Eventually, the levels reoccur a number of times with increasing difficulty.  Jack "defuses" the bombs by simply touching them. As soon as he has touched the first, he triggers a sequence in which another bomb's fuse lights up, and so on. A player can score a bonus in each round by touching all 24 bombs in the correct lit-fuse sequence. Jack may also defuse an unlit bomb by touching it, but this impedes his opportunity to score the bonus for that screen. It also delays the appearance of the game's bonuses and power-ups.  The lit fuses have no strategic purpose other than the bonus; a lit bomb left unattended does not explode.  Enemies such as birds, mummies, turtles, and orbs float around the screen, making Jack lose a life if he touches them. A certain power-up will, when collected, turn all the enemies into coins for a short period.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Boulderdash</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">The object was to move dirt and boulders in order to collect X amount of diamonds. At the same time you had to avoid the falling boulders, and make it to the exit point within a certain amount of time.</div>

<div class="compgameDesc">brake away</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Break Dance</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">EPYX capatalizing on the breakdance fad of '84.  Two people dancing (??) in the middle of a city street where amazingly, no cars exist. </div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Broadsides</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">This game was on the Apple II computer.  I believe that it was made by SSI.  It was effectively a realtime war galleon tactical battle simulator.  A single player could control a "tall ship" against a computer opponent or another player.  As far as I remember, it had no campaign mode or anything of the nature.  A player just chose a ship and battled away with various options such as different ammo types, different sail configurations, and boarding capability.  The much later Ancient Art of War at Sea used a very similar battle engine to this game.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Bruce Lee</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">I barely remember much of it, but you were Bruce Lee climbing up and down ladders.  If you had a second joystick, your friend could control the green computer player.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">bruce lee</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">only trying to give more info on bruce lee.  we beat it a couple times, and it would loop around to the beginning.  the second player could either fight you, or ward off the black ninja guy.  or he could just stand there and moo, since he was a cow (or sumo).  the hardest level was a series of floors with zapping things running across them.  since the game had no set number of lives, it was only a matter of time, though when you play the same level for an hour you tend to quit rather than keep going.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">BSU Basketball</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Basset State University Basketball featuring the BSU Hounds was a all text basketball game for the Apple IIe.  You are a coach of a college basetball team and your object is to coach a college basketball team and move up in the rankings.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">BSU Basketball</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">bubble ghost</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">cannotremember too much because it stopped working but i remember that my son and I loved it</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Buck Rodgers</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Buck Rodgers, a game played back in 1987 on my XT, I used to boot the XT from the 1st 5.14" drive then load the game from the other 5.14" drive. It was about a spaceship stuck on a planet and had to travel along the ground at high speed avoiding floating rocks &amp; debris. Graphics were limited to CGA 4 colour.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">California Games</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">A game that had a variety of sports to play, such as roller skating, surfing, and BMX racing.  You could play it in either the practice or the competition mode.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Captain Blood</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">The objective of the game is to track down and disintegrate five clones (referred to as Duplicates or Numbers depending on the version of the game) of Captain Blood. To find them, the player must speak to various aliens and gain their trust. Communication with aliens occurs via an icon-based interface known as UPCOM. This consists of around 150 icons, each representing a different concept. As each alien race discovered speaks its own language and reacts differently, the player must learn to negotiate using these UPCOM concepts in a style that suits the races.  Other unique facets of the game play of Captain Blood included the deterioration of the player interface as the game progressed. As time wore on, the character's health deteriorated. This was represented in-game via an increasing amount of shaking of the mouse cursor, making the game more and more difficult to control until the character eventually died.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Captain Goodnight and the Islands of Fear</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">created by Broderbund, this was a platformer that showed the foregrounds to Ausin Powers as you had 24 hours to save the world from the smart-alec terror-bomber: the insideous Dr. Maybe.</div>

</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Castle Wolfenstein (Apple ][+)</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">This was one of the first to actually put speech on a computer (in this case German).  The game seemed to absorb a lot of working hours for some people I knew...</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Castle Wolfenstein (Apple ][+)</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Castle</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">I played this game on the Compaq computer back in the mid '80s.  You were a guy that was running all around a castle to all the different rooms, and I believe your ultimate goal was to obtain a scepter.  On the way, you encountered ghosts and ghouls that you had to avoid.  You also picked up various treasures to help you along the way.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Cauldron and Cauldron 2</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">From Borderbrund.  In the first one you're a witch doing something.. battling a pumpkin...I don't remember, but 2 was cool because you were an erratically bouncing pumpkin looking for clues...</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Caveman Olympics</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">You could choose from different cavemen.. events included wife throwing, fire starting, dinosaur racing.. very fun if not for the keyboard interface and button mashing..</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Chernobyl (C64)</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Probably one of the very first simulation-based games.  The name says it all - you're sitting at a control panel in the Chernobyl nuclear power plant ... you log-in, get updated on the situation (meltdown eminent) and use your console to monitor core temperature and controls.  Can you save the power plant before it blows?  Ran on the Commodore 64.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Choplifter</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Apple II/IIE game, objective was to rescue hostages via helicopter and drop them off at "base" while avoiding/destroying tanks and aircraft.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Choplifter</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">This was a 2D game by Broderbund in which you would attempt to rescue your guys on the ground before they got taken out by various airborn enemies. You would land and load up your guys and try and get them back to the safety of your home base. Great sound. Great video. Great fun!</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Simulator</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">This was my first game ever.  Came out in 1987, and allowed you to test-fly several different types of planes- jets and props- from different time eras.  Had day, dusk, and night modes, as well as obstacle courses and the like.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">

Later on there was a giant parrot that would chase you around just to really freak you out at four in the morning</div>

The second was a cavern with scorpians and teleporters.  Then was a room with lava and bubbles you could ride up.  Finally you could take on the evil witch...  I don't remember exactly how the game worked, but it was one of my favorite.</div>

The game concept is fantastically simple and engrossing: your aim is to guide a laser beam through a 2d tile board and destroy all gems or somethings. You do this by rotating various mirrors and polarizing lenses and such but beware: if your beam reflects back to its source for too long it overloads and the thing blows up!

If you make the wrong choices, a picture of a cheesy dragon pops into the picture on your screen and you must start over.  At one point, I remember there being a rabbit in a magician's hat in the dining room.  It's a game geared to very young children.  At that age, my sister and I used to play this for hours and hours.  Even though we had the game memorized, we kept playing anyway.  Back then we must have been playing on Apple ][, Apple ][e or possibly Apple ][+</div>

The object of the game was to fly from planet to planet trading different items available and attempting to make a profit.  Money earned could be used to upgrade your spaceship with better weapons and whatnot.  I dreaded the space station dockings.  At first you had to fly in manually, which took some getting used to.  Afterwards, with some cash, you could purchase a  "docking computer"  which took away a  lot of stress for me!  haha Later in the game, you were given the mission to track down a pirate of sorts and destroy him following clues along the way.</div>

You went through six silly levels of trying to eat the type of food you need to survive as a certain type of animal and you killed some little enemies. On the first board you were an ameoba eating all these little bits while trying to avoid sea animals and one big coconut-like thing tha we used to call "Big mama" LOL. The second level you were a frog that needed to catch these little flies before the fishies ate you. As a mouse you needed to eat all your cheese and make a path so the snakes cannot get you fast enough. As a beaver you swim across a lake to build a dam and avoid alligators. The gorilla board u had to throw oranges at a cat trying to climb a tree; you could only die if they got away or you run outta oranges. The last board, which was more challenging, you were a human avoiding lasers shot by these drones and u had to kill them by letting the lasers reflect off the walls. This was a real fun game altogether...i wish i still had it. It is good for many laughs too!!!</div>

What a blast! Everything in the game (including the ground) was made up of vectors (lines), but we didn't care. We thought it was just like being a hotshot pilot! (here's a chuckle for you... the game took on average 15-20 minutes to load from our so-cool external floppy disk (5.25" of course)drive)</div>

It was primarily for children aged 3-6.</div>

Each room (or "scene") was a puzzle - two goonies enter and you have to figure a way to cooperate your way through the traps, etc. to the exit while avoiding enemies (the Fratellis, steam pipes, octopus, falling platforms at the pipe organ).  1 or 2 players (simultaneous) and played Cyndi Lauper's theme song throughout.  Included all the Goonies + Ma Fratelli and I believe Sloth.</div>

<div class="compgameName">The Great American Cross Country Road Race </div>
<div class="compgameDesc">The Great American Cross Country Road Race was a pretty impressive car simulator from the 80s for Araris and Commodores. It was one of the first car simulators featuring a somewhat complex 4 gearbox, and one of the first games that let you save scores!  There was different game races: you could cruise from SF to NY, from Washington to Miami, or even trying to pass thru a lot of cities as fast as you could go. The nice things about this game was that you could run your car as fast as 250 MPH, had to stop to get some gas from time to time, could be stopped by cops, and weather and time could change!</div>

<div class="compgameDesc">This is a 2D game with you as a human trying to return escaped Mogwais into their cage before they turned into Gremlins at the stroke of midnight.  There's a popcorn maker at the bottom of the screen that flings popcorn all over the screen and when a Mogwai eats it, it turns into a Gremlin which you kill by using your cane.   There's also a fridge which a Gremlin can open and throw food from it. And a tv which will cause all Mogwais and Gremlins to freeze by watching it. Puddles of water means the Mogwai or Gremlin will double after passing through it.  Many levels with different room settings and challenges.  Memorable music too.</div>

<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">The Guild of Theives</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Made for both C64 and Amiga 500 computers. Basically a texted base game with very intricate drawings scrolling down to provide some eye candy to your own imagination. An improvement to the Zork series, and very difficult to win. You played a petty thief trying to gain entry into Kernovia's (first mentioned in a similar game called "The Pawn") legendary Guild of Theives by ransacking a castle and its surrounding area of all its valuables. The end game took forever to understand, and its puzzles remain some of the most difficult in any text based adventure game.</div>

Life could be short and brutal on the Ultimate level. Later ported for the Amiga as Gunship 2000. I still play this game on the C64.</div>

Included player's names, different pitchers with differing strengths (and weaknesses), and spectacular camera view and "split screen" graphics. Featured different batting angles, choice of pitch, and an umpire calling the strikes. Only downside was that the batting order controlled the batter's capabilities (slugger, hitter, "outer,") and not the batter himself. With a friend, hours could be spent without even realizing the time . . .</div>

<div class="compgameDesc">One of the first good 2 player games around. You and a friend took the roles of 2 mercenaries from a top down view point. You had to fight your way through jungles shooting bad guys on foot as well as in tanks. Different weapon types and grenades were available and they could become more powerful through power ups. (ed. made famous for the spinning joysticks that allow you to aim in one direction while moving in another, it also spawned the sequels Victory Road and The Rescue.)</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Impossible Mission</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Impossible Mission" was significant C64 game, in which you played a secret agent infiltrating an underground lab, attempting to piece together a puzzle before the world blew up. 2-D graphics still ran very smoothly; you had a nicely designed proxy character who would run and somersault acrobatically over various levels within underground chambers, dodging killer robots and the like. Early use of voice synth, with a blood-curdling scream if you died, and the villain's famous "Destroy him, my robots" line. Followed by a sequel.  "Hacker" was also a way-cool, though probably too difficult, C64 game. Was simply a disk with no instructions. When you booted up, got a fake password-protect screen asking you to login and give password. You had to guess password and work from there, just like a real hacker stumbling across an unknown system. Eventually you uncovered a complicated scheme involving robots running down secret passages--pretty dull, really. But excellent idea.</div>

<div class="compgameName">In Search of the Most Amazing Thing</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Spinnaker Software put ISOTMAT out sometime in the early, mid-80's. I played it on an Apple //GS (look at all the colors!) my mother brought home on the weekends from her teaching job. You played a young person whose crazy uncle leaves you a spaceship and a mission to find "the most amazing thing." The graphics were amazing for back then, pretty dated now. You piloted a space ship, shopped for supplies, communicated with weird aliens. Our copy had a bug or physical damage to the floppy and locked up at the same place each time, but I'd play it for hours on end, anyway. Awesome game.</div>

<div class="compgameDesc">I do not remember the specifics of the computer but I played the game along with Digger, Frogger and Joust on my dad's old work computer from mid to late 80's.  The object was to get Janitor Joe up the levels on the screen (like donkey kong) without running into the robots that had taken over the building.  You also had to jump over holes and slide along elevators.</div>

<div class="compgameDesc">THE platform game of the 80's! As Willy you had to search the house and colect all the beer glasses before you could go to bed. If you try to go to bed before that you are blocked by you landlady (who is like, twice your size!). The problem is that your house is inhabited by all sorts of wierd and wonderful creatures that want to kill you (that was some party!). Also had the best bug (flaw) in it. Because Willy jumped in an arc you could sometimes loose all your lives by being put back in to a situation where you just fall and die. Still one of the best games ever though.</div>

<div class="compgameName">Journey</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">This was an RPG designed in the very late 1980's.  It is a strategy based game which is very difficult to defeat.  It offers a very large, yet finite, number of choices and the party generated needs to discover its destiny and then save the world.  This was one of the first games to introduce magic on a more realistic-tolkienesk perspective and actually seemed to have some thought from the responses.  This game required patience and brains to try to defeat and the sword could not always be relied upon.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Joust</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">I do not remember the specifics of the computer but I played the game along with Digger, Frogger and Janitor Joe on my dad's old work computer from mid to late 80's.  You were a little man riding on an ostrich-like bird jousting with other ostich-like birds.  Your bird could lay eggs and jump over gaps in the floor (under which was lava) and other birds.  The object was to get your lance over the lances of the others and this caused them to dissapear until you were the last left.</div>

<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Jumpjet (for Apple //e)</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Here is a classic example of just how easy it was to entertain an 8 year old in 1986. The object of the game was to fly your box-like plane off a very small aircraft carrier and bomb evil enemy ships (and in later levels, submarines) before they came close enough to slam into your aircraft carrier. Your plane had only limited fuel so you'd have to go back to the carrier to refuel every few seconds-- either that or attempt the nearly impossible refuelling process on the dreaded fuel blimp that came by every now and then, a craft so worthless that 9 out of 10 times you'd crash your plane by either ramming into it or by running out of fuel before you ever got your tank refilled a single iota. The game got so damn obnoxious after about 2 rounds that I can't picture anyone playing it longer than 5 minutes.</div>

<div class="compgameName">Jumpman (C64)</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">That little red stick figure. Sorta like Pitfall and Donky Kong. Jumpman had to go up and down ladders and ropes; avoid the enemies; and collect little things along the way. There was also Jumpman Jr.  The only change was the size of Jumpman and the game was just a little more challenging.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Jumpman</div>

<div class="compgameName">Kennedy Approach</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">One of the most intense games I played on the C-64 and Atari 800 XL. You're an air traffic controller tracking multiple inbound and outbound planes and attempting to guide them to their correct routes or land them at the various airports on the screen. You also had to manage departure times, altitudes, heavy storms, mountainous terrain, varying flight characteristics (1 space for Cessnas, 2 for commercial craft, and 3 for Concordes), "no-fly" zones, and air traffic conflicts, all in glorious speech and graphics. And just when you have all your craft lined up or stacked at the VOR towers, another one comes in and broadcasts emergency fuel levels. It WILL make you pull your hair out!</div>

<div class="compgameName">Lands Of Lore</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Lands of Lore or LoL is a classical computer role-playing game series by Virgin Interactive, following the tradition of Dungeon Master but introducing a linear scenario-based storyline, rather than characters and feats.King Richard LeGrey is the noble leader and 40th heir of the Gladstone Keep and the White Army. Gladstone is the base of operations for all of the civilized areas. The King is worried about Scotia, a vile old hag and ruler of the Dark Army who has recently acquired the Nether Mask, which is a magical item of extreme power and can now assume the shape of any living creature... or horribly unreal beast.  King Richard gathers together his armies and seeks a champion to go see Roland at his manor and retrieve the Ruby of Truth.  The player has to choose among 4 playable pre-made characters: Ak'shel (a 'Dracoid', an ancient race of dragon-lizard hybrid origin, specialized in magic over might), Kieran, (a 'Huline', another ancient race of human-feline hybrid origin, specialized in dexterity), Michael, (a human specialized in strength and fighting) and Conrad (another human, who is a well-balanced combination of all).  Note: The sequel will rotate through all four characters, showing a different portrait of the former hero, each time you install/restart the game.  When you finally make it to Roland, it is too late. Roland is near death and the Ruby is stolen. Returning to Gladstone you realise that you are again too late: a battle has resulted in the poisoning of the King. And now it is up to you to visit the Draracle and find the ingredients of an elixir that will save King Richard.  Having the recipe for the elixir, the heroes must now traverse the Lands to obtain the required ingredients, while simultaneously learning as much as possible about the Nether Mask in the hopes of defeating Scotia.  The game was critically acclaimed and was followed by two remakes: a CD-ROM 'talkie' version in 1994 which featured an additional narrative history of the Lore of the Lands by Patrick Stewart (who also voices King Richard), and a Special 'White Label' European Release in 1996    </div>

<div class="compgameDesc">The game where you had to get little things from the top of the screen to the target at the bottom or along a "level" by building/blocking/mining/digging etc and trying to kill as few of them as possible.. only problem was it was more fun to kill them than to complete the game!!! Plus anyone whose played it could probably hum the tunes to this day!!</div>

<div class="compgameName">Lemonade Stand</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Another game available for the Apple //c (it was included with the "Apple at Play" pack-in). I saw it available commericially and as shareware, so I assume it was well known to //c fans. The object of the game is to make a huge profit while selling lemonade. You have to factor in how much to make, how much to spend on advertising, and the weather, among other things.</div>

<div class="compgameName">Lode Runner</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">This was the first game I remembered for an actual computer (read: not Atari or Intellivision). You had NO gun, yet bad guys chased you. Your weapon was a drilling ability and they stupidly would run right into the hole and be trapped for a while (2-D is great!) and either climb out of the hole eventually or the ground would fill in and squish them. you tried to gather blocks and climb ladders to the top of the screen and escape to the next level</div>

<div class="compgameName">Lords of Conquest for Commodore 64</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">This game is another version of Risk, but you can choose from about 20 maps, some being old battles like Waterloo. Or if you didn't want to use the maps supplied you could chosse create a world with islands, lakes or no islands. Up to 4 players could play and could take hours or even a year or more to win. You had trees, coal, horses and Iron which to build weapons. You could trade with other players if you wanted to. My three brothers and I played this game unitl around 1993 and I still have Three to Five disks with about 100+ maps and at least 40+ games that we saved since we got the game. Loads of fun but slow loading was a draw back, and If you didn't like a map that the computer made it took another 15 minutes to get to the start screen. Heck I may pull out may C64 and play sometime this up coming week October 2008. I think the game came out in 1982-84 not sure but that is my best quess. Great sounds also. Love C64</div>

The basic premise is to work towards the successful development of your colony while trying to out-manuvere the other players to gain the most wealth.

</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Manic Miner</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">The forerunner to Jet Set Willy. Manic Miner was one of the absolutely best games played on the Spectrum 48K. You should guide your little Miner (same man as in Jet Set Willy) through ten different platforms, and you had to steer him very exactly. If I remember it correctly, this game had the same bug that Jet Set Willy had: if you jumped into something lethal, you would then start from the same position, jumping again until you had no more lives...</div>

<div class="compgameName">The Market Place</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">There was 3 game choices on this one. First choice you could have an apple stand. YOu would choose how many apples to buy and what price to sell them at then you'd sell them. The seoncd choice was pretty much the same except it was with tomato plants. The third choice was the best. It was a lemonade stand. YOu would choice how much to buy of all the ingrediants. YOu would choose how much ice to put in it. Then you'd sell the lemonade. I played this on our old Apple2gs. It was on an old floppy disk.</div>

<div class="compgameName">Match Day 2</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Match Day 2 was an adictive (european) football game for Spectrum 48K. I spent evenings and evenings making leagues and scoring goals. It isn't easy to defeat the computer and if you play with the "Human Goalkeeper" option, probably you will lose, but it's really fun to see your goalkeeper going to the wrong direction.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Math Blaster</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Another "edutainment" title that was played during school hours.  It involved math problems of varying complexity, whose answers would be selected using a small man (think bathroom sign for "men's room") to run across a platform.  Under the platform was a row of 4 or 5 cannons pointing towards the top of the screen. Each were in line with a potential answer for the math problem.  When you had the answer, you made the little man run to where he was between a cannon and an answer.  A press of a key opened the platform, making the man drop into the cannon, and promptly fired out of it and skywards towards the answer.  In essence, a fancy way of making multiple choice somewhat fun and entertaining.</div>

First version required personal mapping of dungeons and outside environs, while killing crypt-like and ancient fantasy creatures; the goal was to reach the Gates to a New World, following in the footsteps of Corak the Mysterious. Sequel was similar, but introduced additional spells and had an automapping feature. The main goal was to find the ghost of Corak and reunite it with his body. Great fantasy game at the time, requiring level ups through experience points in completing quests and defeating monsters with your party's Might and Magic.</div>

<div class="compgameDesc">Unsure if the game was actually branded by Playskool or not. Geared towards 6-10 year olds, you chose simple backgrounds and shapes/objects to create a short animated movie. I seem to recall playing this in the mid to late 80's on a C64. It was a little more advanced than the "Face Maker" game previously mentioned here, but I have never been able to find additional info on this game and am only relying on memory. </div>

<div class="compgameName">NetHack</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">NetHack was the pre-Internet, pre-"Open Source" open-source Internet developed expansion to Hack and Rogue, two games that began their lives on UNIX systems in the late 70's.  NetHack was ported to many of the early 16-bit computers like the Commodore Amiga and the IBM-PC, as well as running on almost all major UNIX platforms (Sun, Apollo, even the NeXT).  NetHack was essentially a character terminal based RPG wherein the main player seeks the Amulet of Endor (sic) deep in the dungeon below.  As the player progresses deeper into the dungeon, he/she develops skills and acquires experience that allows them access to greater and greater weapons, defenses and skills.  An incredibly engrossing game that takes hundreds of hours to complete, it ate a lot of otherwise good programmer waking hours in the 1980s.</div>

</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">not sure</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">it was a game I played in middle school in the 80's.  The way it worked you would create little creatures with premade body parts. For instance you could use a dog like head and put it on a cat like body. they would multiply(breed) if they were a friendly species or would start attacking other species. The point of the game was to see how many species you could get together before they reproduced an aggressive creature or if you accidentally created an aggressive creature you would have to create another just powerful enough to start killing your aggressive creatures. There was a good amount of combinations, but the best combos were usually when they mated. I haven't played the game since high school so I might have a couple things wrong about it. my email is tridration@hotmail.com if you ever figure out what the name of the game is. I would love to play it again.</div>

<div class="compgameDesc">On the Apple IIe systems at my school, we had a variety of educational games. One of these was Number Munchers, and I believe the idea was to eat only the numbers that were the product of two numbers at the top of the screen. You'd hit the spacebar to eat a number, and you had to watch out for these other monsters as well. A load of fun.</div>

</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Omnitrend's Universe</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Probably the most expensive game at the time! I got it for the Atari 800 for nearly 0 mail order direct. The game came in a large, classy black padded loose leaf binder that could fold out to become a stand also, to support the very hefty instruction manual and the numerous floopies. Universe was a more detailed version of ELITE... before ELITE, with chapters after chapters just on creating your own spaceship out of individual compartments and then components. When you are finish your ship, you then buy goods from one planet and sell it at another one, hopefully for a profit. Along the way, you also might have to face other spacers and pirates ala very bare bone basic line graphics like the very first Microsoft Flight Simulator!!! It was micromanagement to the max, staring at screens after screens of database and spreadsheet in between the crude line graphics. I still remember I even have to figure out the approach and landing angles and speeds when going planetside! That was the MOST involving space simulation I have ever played. I wish there are something similar out now that might measure up to it!</div>

<div class="compgameName">Oregon Trail</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">This was one of those embarassing educational "games" that completely missed the mark. Now, we all know that educational games aren't fun-- it's either educational OR fun- it can't be both. And this monstrosity was not fun. It was at times even morbid and just plain nauseating (exacerbated by the unnatural green colors irradiating from the school's monochrome //e monitors). The object was to travel the 2000+ miles across the country with your pioneer family on the Oregon trail to settle new land- supposedly to teach the hardships of enduring such a task. Food was scarce and you'd have to shoot deer, rationing every bullet you had. Every now and then your wife or son or father would die along the way from either starvation, disease, or something of that nature. I always wondered why you weren't allowed to eat the deceased family members if you were out of bullets and starving. I supposed that would be bad form for a game aims at youths age 8-12.</div>

<div class="compgameName">Paradroid</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">One of the best games for the C64. You started out as a basic cleaning robot and you had to destroy all the other robots in two ways (1) by taking over more powerful robots and (2) by shooting other robots. The system for taking over other robots was ingeneous - your robot had to occupy more pieces of a circuit board in 30 seconds than the robot itself, the smaller your robot the less chances you had. Once you took a robot over you could only keep them for given time before you had to take another over or revert back to your orginal weak form - It got pretty hairy in rooms full of powerful robots where a combination if luck, fire power and quick takeovers was the way to win.</div>

<div class="compgameDesc">This was one of the educational games my school computer lab had and it was one of the best.  The screen was a grid with about 12 squares and each round the grid would be filled with different objects.  You would be asked to "chomp" things depending on color, size...etc.  I think there was a time limit and if you chomped something that didn't fit in the category a big x would appear on the square.  I really liked this game :)</div>

<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Pinball Construction Set</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">An awesome Apple game where you actually used a graphical interface to create a pinball table. You could define boundaries and draw special bumpers and allot point totals and even alter the physics. There were rollovers and everything you'd expect in a pinball game at the resolution. Apparently it was the big reason a patrol in my boy scout troop held its own weekly meetings so efficiently.</div>

<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Pirates!</div>
<div class="compgameDesc"> Pirates cemented Sid Meier's claim to fame and stands as one the greatest combinations of role playing, strategy, resource management and action ever to have been produced.  Pirates is an open ended game with a very loosely woven plot.  You begin your pirate career as a slave in a sugar plantation in the Caribbean who has just bought his freedom.  Your brother, sister and father have been lost in your struggles, and you are now on a quest to find them.  This quest can be totally ignored; however, and you can completely dedicate yourself to pirating the seas of the Caribbean.  As captain of a ship you will have to navigate your vessels (for you can build an entire fleet should you wish) through treacherous waters, take advantage of favorable winds, calculate your coordinates, recruit men and manage your food supplies.  In addition to these activities, you must decide whether to pledge allegiance to one of the four nations colonizing the region, whether to betray your masters, ransack cities, search for buried treasure or even marry the daughter of a governor in order to gain title and prestige.  The open ended nature of this game would most likely be its Achilles heel if it wasn't for the fact that you age, and if you don't put a timely end to your swashbuckling antics by settling down and retiring, you will see even simple battles come to a most unfortunate end.  Depending on the riches you own at the time of your retirement, you will be given a different fate -- from a beggar weeping over his lost glory, to the governor of a colonial empire.</div>

<div class="compgameName">Planet Miners</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">All text game.  There were 4 "families" (any not played by an actual person were played by a computer) that would lauch spacecraft to various planets in our solar system hoping to be the first to claim a pre-generated number of mines on various planets.  Each family had five space ships of various levels to do this with.  The level of the spaceship(s) on earth helped influence rulings made by the council who granted mine rights.  The level of the spaceship(s) on the other planets dictated how successful the family was at sabotaging other family's ships and switching markers in order to obtain other family's mines.  Most of the strategy involved planning when to have a ship embark for a planet (some planets such as Neptune and Pluto would take a very long time to travel to) and how to utilize the powers of your ships most effectively.  I believe this was an Avalon Hill computer game, but can't remember for sure. </div>

Only bad thing about this (and the other games in the same series (Curse of The Azure Bonds &amp; Secret of The Silverblades)) were the limitation in leveling.

<div class="compgameName">Portal</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Portal is an oft-overlooked adventure game. It was heavily hyped prior to its release on TV, radio and magazines about how it was going to "revolutionize" computer entertainment. In truth, it was less a game than an interactive novel; it was a passable read but torturous to read on the slow 4-color machines of the day (especially since after every chapter you had to swap disks). Nonetheless, it was a noteworthy game because it was the first game that tried to present computer entertainment to the masses as something more than arcade slashfests. Plus, I think it was also the game that coined the term "multimedia".</div>

<div class="compgameDesc">Incredible (for C64) game that was well ahaed of its  time.  Synopsis:  The Soviet Union, under severe pressure after destruction of one of their biggest oil refineries, must secure a new source of oil, and to do that, they must disable the West... which means they must invade Europe and fight NATO to a standstill... And the only way NATO can prevent that from happening is to reinforce their forces with convoys from the US and other countries.   You are in command of one of the US attack submarines. You must hold the ocean against the Soviet navy at all costs, or the land battle will go badly. Part submarine simulator, part dynamic campaign, and part WW3 simulation, Red Storm Rising is an amazing look at modern warfare. </div>

<div class="compgameDesc">Maybe not the first computer adventure game based on an sf novel but it was one of the most famous during the 80's even if the company putting it out (Tellarium) wasn't.  Follows Arthur C. Clarke's novel pretty closely.  The graphics are really dated now but they put a lot onto two double sided 5 1/4 inch floppys. For floppys back then that translates into still less than 1 meg. But a lotta adventure plus two action type games that actually get incorporated into the story mostly involving landing the ship on RAMA.  Came out for AppleII and Commodore 64</div>

<div class="compgameName">Rescue on Fractalus</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">One of the first titles ever developed by LucasArts (nee LucasFilm Games).  Back when realtime 3D meant SubLogic's flight simulator (in wireframe, at 1 (one!) frame per second), LucasFilm Games shocked everyone with this 3D space flight sim employing fractally-generated terrain and a decent framerate.  The premise: Land on the planet Fractalus and rescue downed pilots.  But don't be too quick to let that humanoid form running towards you into your ship; it might be an enemy Jaggi in disguise (and when that thing pops up on to your screen for the first time, you <em>will</em> jump).  Originally developed for the Atari 400/800.</div>

<div class="compgameName">Rocket Ranger</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Just makes it into the 1980's. This game was available for the C64, Amiga and PC, but was best on the Amiga. It's WW2 and you play the superhero Rocket Ranger. Your mission: to stop Hitler and his evil cohorts from global domination. The game play was a combination of strategy and arcade action and revolved around placing spies in different countries to discover Nazi secret plans, and then flying there for a bit of biffo. It had a definite boys-own feel about it, like shooting down a zepplin to save a defecting German rocket scientist and his......beautiful daughter or throwing away your gun to spar with a dastardly Nazi guard. Best bit: if you lost the Nazi flag was unfurled down the front of the Whitehouse!!</div>

<div class="compgameName">Root Beer Tapper</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">I used to play this on an Adam computer.  There were 2 different parts of it.  One part you had to serve root beer to customers as they appeared and disappeared along the bar.  Every certain amount of levels this dude (who looked like the hamburgler) would pop up and shake 4 out of 5 cans of root beer and switch them all around.  You had to pick out the one he didn't shake.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Sabotage</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Played on old Apple computers, like the II, IIE. You were in control of a turret in the middle of the screen that started with it's gun pointed straight up. You could lay it down either left or right to take aim at the planes &amp; helicopters flying over head dropping off paratroopers who floated down to the ground. If a paratrooper landed he walked over to your turret and stood there. When enough landed they would form a human pyramid (kind of like what cheerleaders or gymnists do) and jump on your turret destroying it. As the game advanced the plane flew faster and if they flew low fast it was hard to get the paratroopers. Great game.</div>

You'd travel from town to town on train, and go to info booths in town capitals to see where the Fuzz had spread, and were given projected forecasts of its spread. To win, you had to defeat the Fuzz TV by having 100 crystals and running into it. You could also save &amp; restore towns by having fuzz infected citizens run into your crystals. Always a good stragetgy to let some citizens take your crystals to help you in your goal. Truly an early eighties classic, and you really needed to know your US geography.</div>

<div class="compgameDesc">Anyone who had an Apple //c has played this game, since it was included with the system's "Apple at Play" disk. Basically, the game features a little tank at the bottom of the screen which you control, and you shoot at the various little aliens at the top of the screen. The aliens moved in different circular paterns across the screen, making it a little more entertaining than Space Invaders. (On a personal note, when I got an Apple //c in 1984, it was the first actual home computer game I ever played).</div>

I forget what computer system it was made for, I know that it was a cartridge and the monitor was the TV screen that you hooked up to the computer. The character was a spring, and using the arrow buttons he had to defeat all the levels, avoiding the enemies. I remeber it well, as my dad played it more than I did, almost to an obsession-like status. To this day, if Springster is mentioned, he reminds us all that he beat the game (had to get to level 50 then back down again?)!!</div>

<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">SSI's Cosmic Balance I &amp; II</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Those were the very first 4X space games for the 8-bit computers! It could have been played on a b/w monitor because there were no colors; there were also minimal graphics, with the tactical screen showing letters representing individual ships and tiny dots representing weapon discharges. I couldn't believe now, how a tiny speck of dot representing a plasma torpedo blinking closer and closer, chasing my own ship could create such tension and terror back then. CB I was the tactical portion, with individual ships jockeying for position to fire against the weakest enemy's shields while CB II was the strategic, planets and systems combat. CB I could play as part of CB II, handling the tactical battles when joined in the larger CB II star map. In fact, The early issues of Computer Gaming World used to hold monthly contests, pitting ship designs submitted by gamers/readers against others- for bragging rights and pitiful prizes, all before we even knew what massive multi online play was. Gamers would spend hours designing ships with shields for different facing with different strengths, placing different weapon systems with different ranges covering different arcs! I remembered a rear-firing torpedo with a tight firing arc used to be an extremely nasty surprise for your enemy who thought he just blast through your weakest rear shields and coming in for the kill. Though the games not licensed for/by the Star Trek (TOS) owners, words and names like Lexington or Enterprise, seige, heavy or light phasers, disruptors, photon and plasma torpedoes, cloaking, warp engines could only conjure up only one sci-fi world in mind!</div>

Your goal was to defend the starbases in your quadrant against the Zylon invaders.  The Zylons attacked with fleets of up to 4 ships in each sector.  You had to hunt them down and kill them before they could surround your starbases.  This game was pretty well unsurpassed until Elite was released.</div>

<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Star Wars</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">The C64 version of the classic arcade. No vector graphics though; everything was raster (e.g. sprites). That, along with the one button joystick made shooting those Tie Fighters increasingly difficult, but with practice you got pretty good at it. All that was missing was the digitized voices of Obi-wan "may the force be with you" and Darth Vader's "I have you now," and of course Luke's "I've lost R2." </div>

<div class="compgameDesc">First, you create your own track or select one of the ones that comes with the program.  Then you pick a car, then an opponent, then your opponent's car (unless you picked the clock).  Then, you race around the track (after answering a question about the manual unless you ran the ST.COM file that came with the bootleg version).  I've made some pretty insane tracks with this.  So insane that people actually started demanding I send them a replay of myself beating it.  I've also made some pretty spectacular crashes, with up to several minutes of airtime, where you sort of fly nose down in the middle of a pixelated fireball until the physics engine lets you come down.  Wanna leap over a building?  You can (though I recommend getting the F1 racer and putting a long straightaway in front of it).  Stymie other players with icy roads, wrong turns that loop endlessly, loop-the-loops immediately followed by slaloms, jumps that send them into the water, buildings in the middle of freaking nowhere (or in the middle of a jump)...the fun is limited only by your own creativity and the programmers of the 80s.</div>

<div class="compgameName">Time Warrior</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Time Warrior was the last in the oeAXE series which is based on the Book "AXE" by the author Frank Oliver.  AXE  was originally to have 3 parts to it...a trilogy...as they were popular at the time of the Spectrum and Amiga machines, and the games were to be (in order):  1. AXE......A tale of Carthelion. 2. AXE II.......Shades Of Evil. 3. AXE III........Beyond The Light.  The complete game package featured a copy of the book, the computer game itself and the board game of the same name produced by Waddingtons.  It also had its own specially recorded musical score bundled with it on cassette.  In the end though, after AXE and Shades Of Evil was produced, Shades Of Evil and AXE was recombined to form what would be the last in the trilogy, "Time Warrior". This did not cause too many problems, though there is still debate with the die-hard enthusiasts as to what Beyond The Light would have held.  We shall never know.  As a side note to this, Shades Of Evil was (and still is) regarded by many as one of the finest fantasy world books since the "Lord Of The Rings", and there is even talk that it could be made into a Hollywood film considering how well LOTR has gone down in cinemas.  The games were produced by an Adventure game company in the mid to late 1980's, called Sifon Software, (they are still around now, but under a different name) and S.O.E picked up numerous accolades and last saw life as an Internet PBEM game in 2002.  AXE was also rumoured to be the inspiration to Mike Singletons oeThe Lords of Midnight. game, but that<sup>TM</sup>s another story!</div>

You can only carry one item at a time and may need to ask old Owl for help as to who they belong to. On the way watch out for Tiggers and Huphalumps! If you return every item you'll be invited to a picnic in your honor whose secret location you will have to find. There all the characters will join in singing the Winnie the Pooh song.</div>

<div class="compgame">

</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Wishbringer</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">This game was interactive fiction. A postal clerk in the town of Festeron is asked to deliver a letter. Somewhere in the game the whole town turns from a quaint town to a sinister town with a new name. A stone must be found and wishes made (using the correct objects for the spell in question) in order to return order to the town.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Witness</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Great word only mystery game where you play a detective in 1930's LA. You get various items (matchbook, newspaper etc..)with the game to help solve a murder mystery in a manor house. </div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Wizardry - Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">THE definitive role-playing game of the 80's.  This is the one that started it all, from Sir-Tech software.  Originally created for the Apple II comptuer.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Wizardry</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Predecessor to the Bard's Tale series using the Middle-Earth, D+D scenarios and characters, but black+white line drawings only. Used the same multi-sectioned screen to show the map, character info and "play-by-play". Had a few sequels. In one version number, there was one of the early cheat codes - you entered a certain room and typed in a code (if memory serves me) and then you could create new types of characters such as Ninja's and Samurai's and even a Monk (btw, the Monk had the best fighting skills, particularly if he had no weapons at all). I recall one of the mages or wizards having a spell call Gutterdamerung - basically the equiv. of a nuclear bomb. I've spent hours of my life on this one. A true classic.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Wizards Crown</div>
<div class="compgameDesc"> I first played this excellent game in 1987 on my C-64c. It was made by SSI and was one of the best role-playing D&amp;D type games of its day. You can play it today on a normal PC (someone reworked the code) I believe it was available for the Apple as well.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Wolfenstein 3d</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">It's a 8-bit First-person Shooter, The first of its time.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Text based game with graphics. Impressive for the time it was released was an animated tornado complete with sound effects that circled the opening description. The plot basically followed  the book rather than the movie version of the story and a little confusingly also incorporated ideas from later in the series. Dorothy and Toto follow the brick road through the Land of Oz and along the way gather companions such as the Scarecrow, Lion, and Tin Man as well as Tip, Jack Pumpkinhead, the Wooden Saw-horse and The Gump. The game was released in 1985 on two 5.25 floppys.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">World Games</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">We had summer, winter -- why not World Games?  EPYX jumped on this and gave us a collection of bull riding, cliff diving, sumo, log rolling, weight lifting and other silliness.  </div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Xenon</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Scrolling shootem-up classic by the legendary bitmap brothers. Had it on my Atari ST (not sure if it was available on tape computers). U could morph your vehicle between a land or air based attack mode. There was also an anonimous bloke with sunglasses who appeared at the side of the screen at the beginning of the level dictating the level number.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Yie Ha Kung Fu</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Classic kung fu at it's 80's best!</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Zak McKracken &amp; the Alien Mindbenders</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Lucasfilm's follow-up to "Maniac Mansion" had you playing the role of a tabloid reporter trying to prevent a group of aliens from reducing the IQs of the human race to single digits. The game had a new age theme with powerful crystals, famous mystical locations (Stonehenge, the Sphinx, Mayan Temple), and dream sharing.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Zany Golf</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">A mini golf game that had different mazes you had to grow through to get to the next level. The first one was a windmill and then I have memories of my mini golf ball hitting the bouncing cheeseburger on a different level.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Zaxxon</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">3d sim where you'd get into space fortress, fight the mighty zaxxon robot himself</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">

</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Zork</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Zork was strictly a text game.  Started out something like: "You are standing in a forest..." that's about all I remember I think they're about to about Zork 4 or 5 now.  I remember in 6th grade I got some tips from a classmate on how to pass some of the boards.</div>
</div>
<div class="compgame">
<div class="compgameName">Zythum</div>
<div class="compgameDesc">Spectrum ZX80. Well all i can say it was a game that entailed jumping and floating and trying to avoid pits and other nasties (which came from left and right) as the screen scrolled right to left and its not easy.</div>
