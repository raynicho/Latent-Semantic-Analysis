<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Update: For more facts and a timeline, see: <a href="http://cleantechnica.com/2016/07/02/tesla-autopilot-fatality-timeline-facts/" target="_blank">Tesla Autopilot Fatality — Timeline &amp; Facts</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A lot more details have surfaced regarding the Tesla Autopilot death that recently occurred in Florida. Unfortunately, they aren&#8217;t very positive for Tesla nor with regards to how the driver was apparently using Autopilot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<em>Update: an extended quote that was here has been removed to respect the privacy of the person who published it on a public forum but didn&#8217;t want it reposted elsewhere. The gist of it was, though, that colleagues of the driver were quite certain that he was on his computer at the time of the accident.</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sad news, but also not a good sign that the driver was probably working on his computer while driving (with Autopilot on). The reports below indicate that he might not have been working, but rather watching <em>Harry Potter</em>. Either way, it sounds like he probably wasn&#8217;t paying close attention to the road.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, one woman who was driving on the same road said that she was going 85 mph when he quickly drove past her. We don&#8217;t know for certain that he was speeding, though, since there is nothing in the police report or Tesla&#8217;s statement regarding that.</p>

</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of these points bring up the concern that people (even former Navy SEALs) get complacent with Tesla Autopilot on. This is something that concerned me <a href="http://cleantechnica.com/2016/04/12/my-tesla-model-x-90d-test-drive-this-suv-blows-me-away-videos/">while testing out Autopilot for the first time</a>. At first, I was very concerned about letting go and was still very attentive, but after a few minutes, even in thick and fast California traffic, I relaxed a lot, and while in conversation with others in the car, my mindset shifted more to that of a passenger. It then hit me that I wasn&#8217;t paying close attention to the road. If this happened to me after just a few minutes of driving on Autopilot, I imagine it really happens to people who own a car with Tesla Autopilot and start to trust it more than they should.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And then, there&#8217;s the really concerning bit about the technology itself. Apparently, even after having its roof torn off, the Tesla Model S kept driving, through fences and such, until crashing into a pole. Not the kind of thing that&#8217;s going to sell more Autopilot Teslas, get regulators to relax, or boost Tesla&#8217;s stock.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Naturally, as Tesla&#8217;s disclaimers say, Autopilot is in beta and drivers are supposed to remain alert and ready to take over at any time. Nonetheless, this is a rather chilling story.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Below is more information on the story from Steve Hanley at <em><a href="http://gas2.org/2016/07/01/exxonmobil-talking-carbon-tax-idea-congress/" rel="canonical">Gas2</a></em>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">New Details About Fatal Tesla Crash Emerge</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>UPDATE July 2 9:00 am.  According to <a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20160701/OEM11/160709985/dvd-player-found-in-tesla-car-in-florida-crash-authorities-say">Automotive News</a>, &#8220;There was a portable DVD player in the vehicle,&#8221; said Sergeant Kim Montes of the FHP in a telephone interview.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The story about the <a href="http://cleantechnica.com/2016/06/30/1st-tesla-autopilot-fatality-130-million-miles/">man who died in a crash</a> while driving his <a href="http://gas2.org/2016/06/30/first-autopilot-death-occurs-florida/">Tesla Model S in Autopilot mode</a> on a highway in Florida is all over the news. When the story broke a few days ago, I first assumed it happened this week. I was surprised to learn later that it actually happened on May 7. I do this stuff for a living (sort of) and so I monitor news about Tesla and Elon Musk fairly closely. Until Wednesday, there was not a single report anywhere on the internet about a fatal crash involving a Tesla back in May. Then Tesla apparently finally found out about the crash and NHTSA got involved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://gas2.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Deadly-Tesla-Autopilot-Accident-Brown.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-49997 size-large" src="http://gas2.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Deadly-Tesla-Autopilot-Accident-Brown-1024x593.jpg" alt="First Tesla Autopilot death" width="1024" height="593" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At first, details were sketchy. We heard that a tractor trailer was making a left turn at an intersection on a four-lane highway with a wide median strip. There were no traffic lights at the intersection. These sorts of road junctions are quite common in Florida and other parts of the country. Whether the tractor trailer was turning left or executing a U turn is still unclear to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In any event, my first reaction was that a large vehicle like that should not have pulled out in front of oncoming traffic. Perhaps the truck driver was partially at fault? If you are building an autonomous driving system, how do you program it to anticipate every stupid thing a human being is capable of, whether it is a truck turning into the path of the car or a clueless pedestrian stepping off a curb into traffic while engrossed in the morning newspaper and drinking a flat white latté?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, details are beginning to emerge and they are disturbing. First, the driver of the Tesla was Joshua D. Brown, of Canton, Ohio. He was 40 years old and a Navy SEAL for 11 years. He left the Navy in 2008, according to the Pentagon. He was a very tech-savvy fellow. He was the founder of his own internet network and camera company, according to a report in the <em><a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/business/autos-latest-news/20160701-tesla-owner-killed-in-crash-was-watching-harry-potter-while-using-car-s-autopilot-survivor-says.ece">Dallas Morning News</a></em>. He posted videos about his Tesla experiences <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NexuJosh/videos">on several occasions</a>, including one showing how the Autopilot system in his car once saved him from a potentially dangerous collision when a white commercial truck swerved suddenly into his lane.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A woman driving on the same highway and in the same direction as Brown claims she was driving 85 mph when Brown&#8217;s Model S flew by her at a high rate of speed. That information is not included in the official traffic accident report filed by the Florida State Police, but is surely something known to Tesla, as it has access to all of the data stored in the car&#8217;s computer system. It is included in a story at <em><a href="http://www.teslarati.com/witnesses-details-deadly-tesla-accident/">Teslarati</a></em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The driver of the tractor trailer, Frank Baressi, age 62, told the <em>Dallas Morning News</em> in a telephone interview that the Tesla driver was &#8220;playing Harry Potter on the TV screen.&#8221; He added, &#8220;It was still playing when he died.&#8221; Baressi said, &#8220;he went so fast through my trailer I didn&#8217;t see him.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t see the video playing, but claims he could hear the movie still playing when the Tesla finally came to a stop several hundred yards up the road. Tesla Motors says it is not possible to watch videos on the Model S touchscreen, but word is that Brown had a portable DVD player in the car.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The really scary part is that not only did the sensors in Brown&#8217;s car fail to detect the tractor trailer directly in front of it, the car itself continued to drive down the highway for several hundred yards after its roof was sheared off. It finally came to a stop in the yard of a home owned by Bobby Vankavelaar. He told <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQNMvHbL3jU">ABC Action News</a></em> that the Tesla traveled “hundreds of yards from the point of impact, through a fence into an open field, through another fence and then avoided a bank of trees before being unable to swerve and miss a power pole that eventually stopped the car a few feet away.”</p>

<p></center></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, is this a &#8216;perfect storm&#8217; event? Someone driving much too fast while distracted, coupled with a truck driver who looked but didn&#8217;t see a car approaching in the opposite direction, in unfortunate lighting for a white truck? And what impact will this have on the advent of autonomous driving technology? Mike Harley, an analyst at Kelley Blue Book, says systems like Tesla&#8217;s, which rely heavily on cameras, &#8220;aren&#8217;t sophisticated enough to overcome blindness from bright or low contrast light.&#8221; He says to expect more deaths as the autonomous technology is refined.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Karl Brauer, a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book, said the crash is a huge blow to Tesla&#8217;s reputation. &#8220;They have been touting their safety and they have been touting their advanced technology,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This situation flies in the face of both.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Really, Karl? We said in a previous post that <a href="http://gas2.org/2016/06/20/statistically-self-driving-cars-fatal-accident/">fatalities will continue to occur</a> even when more cars start driving themselves. The difference is that, statistically, the likelihood of a fatal accident will be less for autonomous cars than cars operated by human drivers. This unfortunate incident occurred after Teslas worldwide had accumulated more than 130 million fatality-free miles while driving in autonomous mode. Statisticians say a death every 100 million miles is normal. So, the Tesla Autopilot system is already 30% more likely to save your life than if you are driving yourself unaided by computers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Elon Musk continues to remind people that Autopilot is still only an aid. Drivers must remain alert, aware, and ready to take control at any time. My wife says autonomous cars are like boats towing water skiers. Most states require there be two people in the boat &#8212; one to steer and one to watch the skiers. She thinks if you are going to use computers to drive your car while you nap or watch videos, another responsible adult should be required to watch the road ahead.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her idea is not as fanciful as it may sound. At the beginning of the automotive age, drivers entering a city were required to have a person on foot walk in front of the car sounding a klaxon to warn the citizenry that a motorized vehicle was approaching. Will regulators require something similar now that we know our machines can fail to protect us from all danger?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My guess is that the impetus of technology cannot be denied. Absent deliberate malfeasance on the part of a manufacturer, the world will accept that there is always an element of risk. The technology will get better. Within a few years, when IHS Automotive says <a href="http://gas2.org/2016/06/29/20-million-autonomous-2035-ihs/">20 million autonomous cars a year</a> will be sold every year worldwide, the chances of a fatal accident occurring in a self-driving car will probably be closer to once every 500 million miles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tesla is very lucky this was a single car accident. If another driver had died as a result of being impaled by a speeding Tesla with its roof sheared off, the odds are an army of trial lawyers would descend on the victim&#8217;s family, begging for a chance to be the first to sue Tesla. In the end, the fate of autonomous driving technology may not be determined as much by regulators as by the courts.</p>

<p>Also computers can do things like observe 360 degrees around the car at the same time, use IR and radar to &#8220;see&#8221; through the dark and fog.  Things humans cannot do.  Computers will get better than humans for the &#8220;last 10%&#8221; of all accidents.</p>
<p>We may never reach 0% but we should approach it very closely.  Each time a detection problem is encountered a solution will likely be worked out and that solution, if software, can be installed on all EVs in a very short time (minutes to hours).  Cannot do that with humans.</p>

<p>&#8211;I&#8217;m not looking for that. But I think it&#8217;s safe to say that computers are going to end up being better drivers that humans. And that we will transition to self-driving cars at some point, with steps along the way.</p>

They are designed for interoperability with applications from many other companies. You can install millions of potential apps, and even have 3rd party bloatware already installed. Code compatibility is top priority. All of this is the root cause of instability. Because the OS maker puts the app marketplace above the stability.</p>
<p>In critical systems&#8230;&#8230; they usually run straight linux or unix, don&#8217;t allow any 3rd party software, and only perform a set task. These systems run missile defense, satellites, aircraft, medical devices, etc. These are computers that don&#8217;t need to be rebooted for years sometimes, unless scheduled for updates.</p>

<p>Just as a matter of note in case it&#8217;s not clear, that&#8217;s a public forum and the media has the right to use information published there (or elsewhere) that is relevant to the news. Naturally, as always, I linked to your post as the source.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m gathering you don&#8217;t want this information shared here for some reason, which I don&#8217;t quite understand since you posted it on a public forum, but since that is the case, I&#8217;ll go ahead and remove it.</p>
<p>Apologies if it was a problem for you in any way. But I&#8217;d also advise against publishing info on a public forum if you don&#8217;t want it out in the public, especially about newsworthy topics.</p>

This speed limit is only applicable to non-divided highways.  On divided highways with a median (such as the one in the crash) the driver is free to select whatever speed he wants to risk getting ticketed for.    Watching Harry Potter (or any other movie) is not something a driver should ever do on the road.  That speed limit loophole may soon be closed by a new update on all Teslas.  Now the lawyers will slap a limit on all speed, regardless of road type.  So soon the autopilot cars will be in the slow lane with all the semi-trucks.   There&#8217;s always one who takes it too far and ruins it for everyone else.</p>

<p>What exactly is the expectation here? That it should violate conservation of momentum and freeze in place? There is a minimum physical limit to this based on the speed of the vehicle and it&#8217;s braking ability. Given that this guy was apparently hauling ass and keeping reacting times and damage to the vehicle in mind, this might be a couple hundred feet with a driver doing all he can under good conditions.</p>
<p>And what is the expectation for a dead, headless human driver making a controlled stop? At that point the vehicle may have been out of control by definition, but there is (sadly) probably some interesting data for Tesla in analyzing what the vehicle was trying to do immediately after impact, because it may be enough to determine if it was trying to stop or trying to continue driving, which would give them guidance on determining when system integrity has been compromised to the point that the car needs to return control to the driver or just stop.</p>
<p>It would have been genuinely alarming if the thing had kept driving until the battery went dead.</p>
<p>Also, count me as shocked (shocked) that it is possible to set the autopilot to exceed the posted speed limits.</p>

<p>If the driver reacted prior to the crash then the vehicle should not have proceeded on under power.  At least nothing more than a crawl.  The cruise control would have been canceled and it&#8217;s unlikely anything pushed down on the accelerator after the crash.</p>
<p>(But rule nothing out at this time.)</p>

Also the now dead driver could have slumped down on the pedals keeping the car under partial power without providing any steering guidance.  The final impact with a utility pole would have triggered the airbags. The car can never override driver input, even if its a dead driver.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Nevada drivers caught with their hands anywhere but on the wheel were liable to be ticketed. [The ordinance] states that when a person is operating a vehicle they must provide full attention to the driving so that it won’t render that action to be unsafe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since that also agrees with Teslas simple and clear instructions, you wouldn&#8217;t have much chance in court even if you said you were in auto-pilot.</p>
<p>Police everywhere need to be educated about exactly what auto-pilot is so they do not think the above is okay.</p>
<p>That said, I constantly see people holding and talking on their cell phones and the police do not pull them over even though this causes many thousands of deaths a year.</p>

<p>There SHOULDN&#8217;T be, correct.   But there is.  NHTSA and Tesla both talk about levels of autonomy.  But the public simply won&#8217;t read past headlines of WSJ, CNN, Fox News, Bloomberg, etc.</p>

<p>The finished auto-pilot on Tesla will be exactly the same. It is not the same as autonomous and even early autonomous vehicles will still need to allow humans to take control for both technical and psychological reasons.</p>

1) semi driver could have not turned in front of traffic<br />
2) the Tesla driver could have been better monitoring the road</p>
<p>However, if 1) hadn&#8217;t happened, there would have been no accident. The Tesla driver could have been driving without autopilot &amp; monitoring the road &amp; still have been involved in the collision because of the irresponsible driving of the semi driver. That is the point I was trying to make. It&#8217;s not like the Tesla driver is the one who made the dangerous maneuver that caused the crash.</p>

It went on to go through two fences, I would have expected it to stop for those, but it did not (maybe it tried but on grass it could not stop before it had penetrated them at which point it would have no reason to slow again, other than the lack of forward looking camera data). Me thinks Tesla should make a small change to the software so that a car without camera data or with triggered air bags would drop out of traffic aware cruise control and come to a stop via the electric rear P brake. Just as well this was not a heavily populated area.</p>

I know a lady alleges he passed her at high speed while she was doing 85mph but Tesla and the authorities must have a figure from the logging equipment in the car.<br />
He literally did have a recent record of travelling at close to double the posted speed limit in a 35mph zone so it would not surprise me if he was speeding but as Tesla pointed out the car&#8217;s software limits cruise to 5mph above the local speed limit (but weirdly my speed sign reading Tesla often misreads an 80kph sign as 30kph and yet I can still use traffic aware cruise control at 80kph, what is going on there ?). He did run some kind of electronics/software/networking company so with unrestricted access to his car&#8217;s computers perhaps he had hacked it in someway to overcome that restriction.<br />
For myself I tend to stick to the traffic regulations since I like to keep my licence, and keep it clean. It is not a higher morality that sees me sticking to the rules, just base self interest.</p>

<p>The main point I&#8217;m trying to make, is that with Volvo, you must physically keep your hands on the wheel to keep the &#8220;assisted driving&#8221; (I think that&#8217;s what they call it) turned on. Removing your hands, the car automatically believes you&#8217;re distracted. Not in Tesla, you&#8217;re free to turn auto pilot on and watch Harry Potter on your laptop with your hands completely off the wheel. Auto Pilot only turns off with adverse road conditions, as you previously mentioned. It&#8217;s a bad system, look at the guy who was sleeping in traffic&#8230;.would have been impossible for him to do that with Volvo&#8217;s system.</p>

Currently, I believe those who sleep or are distracted with their Tesla (or any vehicle for that matter) in auto pilot are irresponsible.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s also why Volvo is calling theirs a driving assistant and not an auto pilot mode. It&#8217;s technically fully autonomous, but, you still need to have some input. Great for traffic, great for the highway. But you still need to pay attention because stuff happens, deer can jump out in front of you (or in Sweden, moose, which is much worse), people can drive erratically and endanger your life through their stupidity and you as a driver need to be paying attention to avoid injury to yourself and others and be able to take control of the vehicle to avoid an incident if need be..auto pilot or not</p>

Tesla doesn&#8217;t market directly to the masses&#8230; so most non-Tesla owners only go by what the media is saying. And we all know how the media really tells a story. Tesla is upfront about their capabilities, then the media hypes it up to be more sensational and to drum up the natural reactions of fear.<br />
Very few non-owners even know how Autopilot really works, but they THINK they do, which is dangerous.<br />
Perhaps there is nothing wrong with the word&#8230; but rather the ignorance of the public.</p>

<p>But that still doesn&#8217;t mean you can take your eyes off the road. Honestly, an airplane isn&#8217;t the best analogy&#8230;seeing as how you won&#8217;t find deer or other large animals at 26,000ft where auto pilot can be engaged, and the only thing they have to avoid are other planes moving at 500 MPH that are all constantly monitored by air traffic control. And trying to avoid a bird in a plane going 350+ is like trying to dodge a pebble falling off a dump truck in front of you on the highway.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said, I have a fairly decent understanding of Tesla&#8217;s AutoPilot and have been lucky enough to try it out. But the same morons that require &#8220;Caution: HOT CONTENTS&#8221; warnings on cups of coffee are the same reason there need to be greater safeguards on the technology. Tesla&#8217;s system works, and works well&#8230;people are just stupid lol</p>

<p>I will say again&#8230;<br />
The point is that having paneling under the truck trailer, would have been more visible to both the human eye and the radar&#8230; <strong>thus NOT allowing it to hit it.</strong></p>
<p>BTW, the &#8220;not ready for prime time&#8221; is a cliche without meaning.  What is &#8220;prime time&#8221; to you?  When it is statistically 50% better than a human?</p>
<blockquote><p>Think of a Venn diagram of two circles. Overlapping but different sizes.<br />
Circle A is all the accidents avoided by Autopilot, Circle B is all the accidents avoided by human drivers.<br />
The overlap section represents accidents that both could avoid.<br />
This instance could be exclusively within B, and not A&#8230; But there are plenty of fatal accidents that are exclusively within A and not B. Since we know that human error is a huge part of unavoided accidents, this area is potentially huge.<br />
As long as Circle A has the potential to be larger than Circle B,.. And we do know this since Circle B isn&#8217;t getting bigger over time (humans can&#8217;t evolve as quickly as computer/machine learning)&#8230;we should continue to pursue autonomous vehicles.</p></blockquote>

<p>There&#8217;s no excuse to allow a system which does not monitor the entire &#8220;box&#8221; into which it is about to drive.</p>
<p>Is the radar simply not focused up high enough?  Radar aimed a few degrees higher than level should have picked up the target early.  If the angle between the bottom of the signal was not rising rapidly, as it would with a bridge, then the computer should have gone into stop mode.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a point reached at which the car is close to the last possible moment to brake.  An object is in the car&#8217;s path.  It&#8217;s low enough to hit the car.  Car needs to stop.</p>
<p>In this case car did not stop.</p>
<p>This time it was a trailer.  Next time it might be a wind turbine blade. Or a bridge section on wheels.  We&#8217;re not going to hang Tesla-guards on everything that crosses the road.<br />

<p>You don&#8217;t need to go probability and Venn diagrams with me.  I&#8217;m highly numbers driven.  What I&#8217;m doing here is talking about general public acceptance.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m certainly not saying that we should not move to self-driving autos.  I&#8217;m just saying Fix the Damn Problems.</p>
<p>And, probably, turn off the systems (at least at high speeds) until this problem is fixed.  (I can explain mathematically why that&#8217;s a good idea&#8230;. ;o)</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-412122" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Here is the reason why it isn&#8217;t as simple as refocusing the radar to get a perfectly informed data set:</p>
<p>With any sensor package&#8230; for any given second, there are anomalies that don&#8217;t fit the rest of the data.<br />
If 90% your sensor readings show clear road ahead, the readings that show otherwise may be discarded as anomalous.<br />
The question is&#8230;. can Tesla simply software tune the logic to accept more potentially anomalous readings? What would that do for the rest of the driving?<br />
Or does Tesla need to add another set of sensors to clear out some of the noise?</p>
<p>Simply pointing the radar higher would probably create more false positives too.</p>
<p><em>turn off the systems (at least at high speeds) until this problem is fixed. (I can explain mathematically why that&#8217;s a good idea&#8230;. ;o)</em></p>
<p>This sets a precedent that we should react before more information is known.<br />
More importantly, it stops all learning of the system.<br />
And what happens when someone is killed by a model S driver who would have been on autopilot, but couldn&#8217;t because of this hold?</p>
<p><em>This time it was a trailer. Next time it might be a wind turbine blade. Or a bridge section on wheels. We&#8217;re not going to hang Tesla-guards on everything that crosses the road.</em></p>
<p>Huh?  What wind turbine blade swings as low as a Tesla?<br />
We are talking about tractor trailers.  Everything you can think of would be carried on top of one of these trailers anyway.  </p>
<p><strong>250 people die every year from this problem.<br />
</strong><br />
NHTSA is well within their scope to do this, like they did for the Mansfield Bar</p>
<p>&#8220;Jayne Mansfield (and Sam Brody &amp; Ronnie Harrison) did not die in vain. Their death led to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requiring all semi truck trailers to be equipped with a DOT Bar. You know it better by it’s other name: the Mansfield Bar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sorry.  I want my odds to be a lot better.  I want the car to see solid objects lower than the car&#8217;s roof.</p>
<p>At this point in time at least alert the human of data conflicts and let them make the decision.  Go into crash avoidance mode.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got data conflicts like this happening often then it&#8217;s back to the drawing board.<br />
&#8212;</p>
<p>Tesla could turn off the lane-keeping system at speeds higher than &#8220;20&#8221; miles an hour but continue to collect data.  Keep looking for situations where the human slows, swerves, brakes but the system wouldn&#8217;t have.</p>
<p>Allow lane-keeping only at speeds in which a crash should result in no harm to belted passengers.  And require the passengers to be belted even at very low speeds.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the point, IMO.  If you&#8217;ve got data coming in from one set of sensors that says shit is about to happen and from one or more set that says &#8220;won&#8217;t&#8221; you pay attention to the set that&#8217;s issuing the warning.

The sensors cannot tell the exact height of the &#8220;sign&#8221;, since the computer would have to know the exact curvature of the road surface.  It is easy to fool radar like this, at that distance and speed.  Which is why Tesla explicitly said that it cannot determine everything.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as perfect information.  The car didn&#8217;t have 100% of the information.  Neither do human drivers&#8230; lots of blind spots, blinking, yawning, tuning the radio, and poor reaction time.<br />
It miscalculated a window of a few feet, from a distance and high speed.  </p>
<p>Yes better sensors can and will eventually fix the gap&#8230; but requiring trailers to have paneling would fix it too, and save the lives in non-autonomous accidents too.</p>

If it were not it would false trigger on overpass bridges and above road signage. In fact their is an overpass that used to cause my Tesla to decelerate every time I drove that stretch of slightly up hill road before that overpass. That annoyance only happened with an earlier software version so I assume the ignore line has moved down a little lower with the current version. The fatal Tesla was driving on a slight down slope so couple that with the fact the centre section of the trailer was high the camera almost certainly saw it but chose to ignore it since it was set up to assume anything that high was an overpass  or overhead highway signage. We know from the Tesla hitting the trailer during a Summon event the car will not stop for stuff just below roof height, approaching a trailer from a downhill slope would just make things worse.<br />
I don&#8217;t buy the poor lighting story. The car was coming from the west, going east which means at 3-4pm the sun would be behind the Tesla, ideal lighting conditions really to see even a white trailer against the sky and the Tesla was on a slight down-slope so their is some possibility the trailer would be set against the darker background of the road surface, either way I&#8217;d bet money the camera saw the trailer but just ignored it as being too high to present a danger.<br />
Side impact guards would go a long way to reducing that 250 deaths a year from vehicles going under trailers and give the semi autonomous vehicles a close to 100% chance of realising that that is a stationary vehicle ahead and not an overhead sign.</p>

And yes, Autopilot stumbled several to many times per hour of such video I watched.   (They were making demo videos of what Autopilot is like). </p>
<p>Hopefully regulators will notice how people actually behave and strictly ban such testing on public roads for the general public. </p>
<p>And don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m no luddite.  I welcome this technology and hope to have a safe fully automated car within 20 years, so I can maintain my mobility as I age. </p>
<p>OTOH, this technology seems to provoke behavior like texting on steroids, so I don&#8217;t want it used by untrained/inattentive people on public roads.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-412535" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>That remains to be seen.  If the system is a typical traffic following system like all the rest (Subaru, Honda, Mercedes, etc), it saw the tractor pass across and assumed a vehicle had crossed the lanes and continued. It may have seen the trailer wheels 50 feet behind the tractor and assumed it was a different vehicle. If the car was travelling as fast as the witness indicated (85+ mph) it would need close to 300 feet to stop once an object is detected. Assuming it saw the tractor pass across while over 500 feet away and the wheels not yet in the road it should have continued on.   At 10 mph, the trailer needed nearly four seconds to clear the road after the tractor had passed.  Since the trailer wheels never entered its lane, the tractor must have been moving slowly across the road while the car was covering over 130 feet a second, covering over 500 feet in those 4 seconds.<br />
The auto-pilot system apparently cannot detect objects above the road, only objects on the road.   This is further indicated by the recent accident where a man summoned his Tesla and it rolled forward into a semi-trailer that was parked in front of it, striking its roof on the trailer hitch area.   These two incidents combined indicate that objects above the road but not in contact with it are not captured by the camera nor the radar/laser scanners. Clearly this scenario is beyond the capability of all current collision avoidance systems, but the driver should have seen the trailer over the road for over 5 seconds and slammed on the brakes.</p>

<p>ever notice &#8220;computer gliches&#8221; build up IN YOUR LAPTOP&#8230; eventually you got to defrag&#8230;reboot&#8230;</p>
<p>the &#8220;bottom line&#8221; NO SOFTWARE or computer IS NOT GOING TO &#8220;MALFUNCTION&#8221; at some point&#8230;AND THAT&#8217;S NOT COUNTING&#8230; &#8220;THE USER CAUSING THE GLICHE OR PROBLEM&#8230;</p>
<p>this is a &#8220;whole bunch of hype nonsense&#8221; &#8230;FOR THE ENTIRE &#8220;AUTO INDUSTRY AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE INDUSTRY&#8221; TO EVEN START DOING THIS &#8220;BECAUSE OF PROFIT-POTENTIAL DRIVING THOSE TWO BIG INDUSTRIES&#8230;</p>
<p>all you need is &#8220;sunspots&#8221; &#8230;some other big &#8220;electromagnetic hotspot&#8221;&#8230;and GLICHE goes the computer&#8230;</p>
<p>it&#8217;s one thing if the &#8220;computerized processors&#8221; in a car that regulate things like &#8220;ignitiion&#8221; malfunction termporatily or get fried&#8230;</p>
<p>but something LIKE &#8220;AUTOPILOT&#8221; DRIVING YOUR CAR AT SPEED&#8230;</p>
<p>THIS IS ALL &#8220;SO DUMB&#8221;&#8230;cruise control IS BAD ENOUGH&#8230; I USED IT TWICE IN TEN YEARS&#8230;and it proved more of a distraction&#8230;</p>
<p>plus the &#8220;litigation&#8221; figuring who/what/how much&#8230;the driver or the system was at fault&#8230;</p>
<p>look at &#8220;plane crashes&#8221; like the Eastern Airlines L1011 crash in the Florida in 1972&#8230; because the crew was &#8220;so engaged with a warning light&#8221; THEY FAILED TO NOTICE THE &#8220;AUTOPILOT DISENGAGED&#8221;</p>
<p>SO&#8230;ALL THIS &#8220;MAKE IT EASIER STUFF&#8221; &#8230;is NOT A SOLUTION or the WAY TO GO&#8230;in all situations&#8230;</p>
<p>especially&#8230;if the &#8220;average person&#8221; can&#8217;t drive &#8230;without AUTOPILOT&#8230; you gonna let them because they got autopilot&#8230; ARE THERE &#8220;continous feedback road warning sensors on our highways???</p>
<p>when I first heard about AUTOPILOT technology&#8230;the thinking was&#8230; highways would have &#8220;sensors, monitors, feedback and CONTROL systems INTEGRATED with &#8220;some kind of AUTOPILOT&#8221; TECH in the car&#8230;</p>
<p>all we have today IS SOME PRETTY SOPHISTICATED SOFTWARE&#8230; that is bound to fail&#8230; because &#8220;driver is going down a ONE WAY ST&#8230; the wrong way&#8230; DOES IT COVER THAT&#8230; can sensors read &#8220;someone running a red light&#8221;&#8230; or a child dashing out right in front of you FROM BETWEEN PARKED CARS&#8230;</p>
<p>I can see &#8220;added safety features&#8221; like RANGE AUTO BRAKING&#8230;but THIS KIND OF STUFF&#8230; MEANS </p>
<p>ALL THIS &#8220;AUTOPILOT STUFF&#8221; IS &#8220;ONLY&#8221; A &#8220;BACKUP&#8221; &#8230;not to be depended upon&#8230;</p>
<p>all this &#8220;autopilot stuff&#8221; is ONLY THAT &#8230;AND WILL BE LIKELY THAT FOR DECADES YET&#8230;</p>
<p>you don&#8217;t let CARS DRIVE THEMSELVES&#8230; even if you can &#8220;program one to do that&#8221; under IDEAL CONDITIONS&#8230;<br />
&#8230;one glitch in the software&#8230; one burned out circuit&#8230;or hotspot electromagnetic pulse&#8230;</p>
<p>AND &#8220;WILD CAR&#8221; with or without driver&#8230;</p>
<p>and HOW DO YOU LIGTIGATE SOMETHING LIKE THAT&#8230;could be in the courts for YEARS&#8230;in each case&#8230;</p>
<p>so the GUY GOT AUTOBRAKING and car shuts off it is hands release steering wheel&#8230; like &#8220;old person&#8221; having stroke or heart attack&#8230;THAT&#8217;S FINE&#8230;</p>
<p>IT&#8217;S AN &#8220;ADDITIONAL SAFETY FEATURE THAT CAN BE USEFUL&#8221;&#8230; BUT PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN PUT THE CAR ON &#8220;AUTOPILOT&#8221; AND TAKE A KNAP&#8230;while behind the wheel&#8230;</p>
<p>give me a break&#8230; ARE YOU PEOPLE GOING &#8220;LOONEY-TUNES!&#8221;</p>

A &#8220;driver&#8221; engages a speed control software with lane keeping assist and collision &#8220;mitigation&#8221;.  The software is engaged at well above the speed limit and he stops looking at the road to watch a movie.   So somehow the car (and its manufacturer) is responsible the resulting crash and death of said driver.  A 40 year old dying to see Harry Potter is bad enough.  Making everyone and everything else responsible for his extreme lack of judgement is the definition of &#8220;ludicrous&#8221;.   I am a licensed pilot and I watch the gauges and outside while auto pilot is engaged.  There are too many things that can go wrong the software was not designed to account for.  So how can this car and by extension its manufacturer be all knowing and account for the truck turning across all lanes in the scenario mentioned above.  The most likely scenario is the car was going too fast and the truck too close for even a human to prevent a crash.  Also, everyone is assuming the auto-pilot was still engaged after the crash, but it was not.  The proof is in the car veering off the road into a field, hitting a fence and a pole.  Auto pilot would have keep the car on the road in its lane.   So either the driver hit the brakes just before impact and disengaged the auto-pilot or the auto-pilot self disengaged just before impact.  Once it was disengaged and the crash occurred, the now dead &#8220;driver&#8221; was back in charge, thus the car randomly coasting across a field and hitting a pole.   Sure a lawyer can argue the definition of &#8220;is&#8221; in court, but this is a clear case of driver error.</p>

Snow? ice storms? in rush hour traffic? How many of the 130 million hours were driven on safe driving courses during the middle of day with near perfect driving conditions? </p>
<p>I love technology but I had to restart my 9 month old phone twice in the last week. I have to do hard resets of my 11 month old Windows 10 laptop 3 times in the past 2 weeks. Many people in this thread seem to think humans shouldn&#8217;t be driving cars because they aren&#8217;t reliable yet these same people are willing to trust an autonomous driving car programmed by the same people. </p>
<p>Lastly, given that this was Tesla&#8217;s fault will the dead man&#8217;s family and the truck driver as well as the man whose yard the card ended up in be able to sue Tesla?</p>

<p>Tesla DOES have the statistics of &#8220;How many miles&#8221;&#8230; Guess what, it is the SAME amount of miles a typical sedan driver would drive in fog, rain, snow, ice, and traffic.<br />
And ZERO MILES on some &#8220;safe driving course&#8221;.<br />
These are real world, typical miles driven.</p>
<p>Congratulations on you phone.  And your Windows laptop.<br />
Personal computers/smartphones aren&#8217;t designed with reliability as the top priority.  They are designed for interoperability with applications from many other companies.  You can install dozens of apps, and even have 3rd party bloatware already installed.  All this causes instability.<br />
In critical systems&#8230; they usually run straight linux or unix, don&#8217;t allow any 3rd party software, and only perform a set task.  These systems run missile defense, satellites, aircraft, etc.  These are computers that don&#8217;t need to be rebooted for years sometimes, unless scheduled for updates.</p>

<p>There are many, many warnings. Here are just a few:</p>
<p>&#8220;Warning: Do not depend on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to adequately and appropriately slow down Model S. Always watch the road in front of you and stay prepared to brake at all times. Traffic-Aware Cruise Control does not eliminate the need to apply the brakes as needed, even at slow speeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Warning: Traffic-Aware Cruise Control can not detect all objects and may not detect a stationary vehicle or other object in the lane of travel. Depending on Traffic-Aware Cruise Control to avoid a collision can result in serious injury or death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Warning: Many unforeseen circumstances can impair the operation of Traffic-Aware Cruise Control. Always keep this in mind and remember that as a result, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control may not slow down or may brake or accelerate Model S inappropriately. Always drive attentively and be prepared to take immediate action.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are many more but the above basically predicts this sad scenario if not followed. It&#8217;s very simple, you still have to always be ready to take over.</p>
<p>I agree that the truck was in the wrong too but the Tesla driver was speeding and, most egregious, not even watching the road but a movie instead, so I think he gets most of the blame.</p>

<p>1).  Into the hands of the public in BETA mode? </p>
<p>2).  Called &#8220;Autopilot&#8221;, which is a misleading marketing term, until it is certified safe?</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what happens when regulations come out about automated driving, and how much such things are limited.  Oh, and Tesla hurrying to do this before regulations are even produced is a way to try to jump ahead of the competition, but a very bad way to demonstrate true concern for public safety.</p>

It does indicate that it isn&#8217;t a perfectly safe driver, but I knew that. Didn&#8217;t you?<br />
Remember the old Apple &#8220;Think different&#8221; ad campaign? One thing to watch out for is that computer programs often think very differently than people (even their programmers).<br />
I read &#8230; somewhere &#8230; that the radar picked up the truck, but misclassified it as a sign above the road. Perhaps it relied on the cameras to calculate its actual height, and the cameras couldn&#8217;t find it at all?<br />
If Autopilot can be shown to be safer than the average driver, (hint: it can&#8217;t, yet) then it is time to start requiring autonomous capability on all new vehicles, especially if autonomous capability is improving. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the mistakes made by autonomous vehicles aren&#8217;t the same mistakes a human driver would make.<br />
What I&#8217;ve read suggests that there is some low-hanging fruit for improving Autopilot, but that is based on a LOT of supposition.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t know that.  We&#8217;ve got one single death which is not enough data points to determine the safety level of the system.</p>
<p>We could look at non-fatal accidents and get a better idea but we don&#8217;t have that data.</p>
<p>Musk has said that the system was twice as good as humans (something like that) but I&#8217;m not sure what data he&#8217;s using.</p>
<p>Fact is, this hole in the system might be the only hole, period.  Fix this one and there might never be another fatality while the system was driving.  Or there could be lots of yet to be discovered holes.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a whole bunch of stuff we don&#8217;t yet know.  We&#8217;re (some of us anyway) giving the truck driver partial blame for making the turn across traffic.  But suppose the Tesla had been in the far right lane and coming up very fast behind a larger vehicle traveling at a lower speed.  The truck driver starts his turn based on his (correct) judgement that he&#8217;s leaving the vehicle he sees plenty of room.  He gets part way through the turn, the Tesla driver flicks the turn signal, goes back to his movie,  the Tesla quickly swings around the large, slower vehicle and on into the truck.<br />
Not saying that happened.  Have no idea.  Just suggesting that that we don&#8217;t know enough to really figure out what happened.</p>

That was my main point. Are we agreeing? If Autopilot had logged 10 times the average miles/fatality with only one fatality, it would be highly unlikely that it was as bad as the average driver.<br />
I don&#8217;t think Autopilot has the same use profile as a typical driver; it certainly doesn&#8217;t if people have been following the instructions in the manual. That may warp the statistics.<br />
My secondary point, restated, is that Autopilot&#8217;s accident profile may be very different from a human driver&#8217;s accident profile. It could deal with machine-like perfection with situations it assesses correctly, but seem utterly blind in situations it assesses incorrectly. This sad incident seems a good example of that blindness.</p>

Whether it be my toe against a random chair or curb, or hopefully not me vs semi truck again (once was enough for me!). Autonomy while driving is about a MORE safe system than my own. Currently the BETA for Tesla is supposed to be a supplement to the driver, an assist mechanism just as cruise control is. I, the driver, am the final failsafe in the vehicle. Both machines in the accident were guided there by the driver, and both drivers made a mistake that cost a life.  It was not the hardware or the software in their vehicles that caused each of them to abuse the intended purpose of their vehicle and how it should safely be driven.</p>

Point is that our extremely spacially aware and overly paranoid brains in all their glory still make mistakes. The Tesla sensors missed the truck, but so did the sensors on the exponentially more powerful human brain. There will always be crazy situations that are just bug house nutz, one in a trillion happenings. There will be failure, so to set the expectation of perfection on yourself, others, or any software is just ludicrous! (BA da Tsch!)</p>

It is speculation that he was watching a movie and not the road. The fact is neither the Tesla, nor the driver reacted to the Semi pulling in front of the vehicle. What will be important is to know the speed of the Tesla, sun location in relation to the car, and the trucks visible location to the driver. I have had vehicles and pedestrians suddenly pop out from behind pillar blind pots before because their speed and orientation to mine kept them hidden until the last moment. As for Autopilot I would bet that the speed of the Tesla was just right for the radar and camera to &#8220;not see&#8221; the cab of the semi as it crossed the road, nor see the rear tires of the trailer either. It will be interesting to find out just how perfect the timing had to have been to fool the driver and Autopilot. It&#8217;s just the law of big numbers. The more time you have, the more likely the unlikely becomes.</p>

And these 130 million miles were likely mostly divided highway miles (those are Tesla&#8217;s instructions as to when to deploy).  The one fatality per 90 million miles for other cars includes a lot of miles driven on roads other than divided highways.</p>

<p>The amount of data already compiled by Tesla is much, much more than the insurance industry uses to access risk for new cars and systems and the insurance industry is very successful at this and, hence, one of the most profitable businesses in the world.</p>
<p>Much less data was used to prove the Tesla&#8217;s vastly superior fire safety over ICE cars years ago and it has shown to be completely accurate even though I went through many arguments that &#8220;there wasn&#8217;t enough data&#8221;.</p>
<p>As Musk has said, there is no question here if you do the math.</p>
<p>&#8220;If anyone bothered to do the math (obviously, you did not) they would realize that of the over 1M auto deaths per year worldwide, approximately half a million people would have been saved if the Tesla autopilot was universally available.

<p>Do this, Ken, find the number of fatalities per million miles on divided highways that are not due to driver drinking, texting, etc. and then we can start to compare the effectiveness of Tesla&#8217;s collision avoidance system vs. unimpaired human drivers.</p>
<p>It makes no sense to use one database that includes driving on more dangerous roads and includes impaired humans with another database that includes no impaired humans and only the safest of roads if we&#8217;re trying to answer the question of whether the Tesla system is best at spotting problems like trailers across the lane.</p>

<p>Also, if you read the Tesla forums, you will see many people use auto-pilot on other than divided roads &#8211; including me.</p>
<p>You should also understand that one death in 130 miles is not a single data point. There were many possibly fatal accidents avoided within that 130 million miles which were also data points.</p>
<p>The statement is that auto-pilot, as is being used in the real world right now, is safer than a human driver and that is exactly what the data proves.</p>
<p>In fact, if you eliminate flagrant misuse of the system, there have been exactly zero deaths involving auto-pilot.</p>
<p>As for the insurance industry, they set insurance rates on Teslas with much, much less than 130 million miles of data. That is a simple fact. They would not be able to do that unless they could make accurate predictions with many fewer miles driven. It is done all the time.</p>

<p>You are completely wrong about how Tesla uses passive data. It shows what auto-pilot would or wouldn&#8217;t do in all driving situations. Try doing some research before making statements about things you don&#8217;t know about or understand.</p>
<p>You are also wrong that it is because Musk said it that makes it true, it&#8217;s because I hold multiple degrees in physics and economics and have dealt with insurance probabilities on new system designs.</p>
<p>I guess you need to contact Musk and explain he doesn&#8217;t understand his own data, if you can catch him in between space launches.</p>

<p>If you think he is wrong or dishonestly misrepresenting something you should show how.</p>
<p>Since Musk has seen close to 1 billion miles of Tesla auto-pilot data both active and passive, I happen to agree with him.</p>
<p>Musk is able to compare accident and injury rates between Teslas using auto-pilot and Teslas not using auto-pilot.</p>
<p>And because this death was caused by not using the system correctly, it was not even the system&#8217;s fault. </p>
<p>Again, Musk made the same claims about Teslas being much safer than gasoline cars in terms of fire danger when many (wrongly) claimed that there was not enough data &#8211; and Musk was proved right, though actually quite conservative, in the Tesla&#8217;s superiority.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-413029" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Tesla has plenty of data on its own cars.  The issue is the comparison to non-autopiloted cars is not an equal comparison.  Just because you don&#8217;t understand basic logic and statistics doesn&#8217;t make me wrong.  Passive data gives us zero info about the safety of autopilot because it isn&#8217;t isn&#8217;t in use so that isn&#8217;t useful in this comparison.  Tesla says from their autopilot data, they&#8217;ve seen 1 fatality.  However autopilot is primarily used in situations where the chance of fatality is fairly low.  Tesla then compares their autopilot data against data from ALL miles driven in all types of situations (bad weather, unlit back roads, etc).  For a fair and meaningful comparison, the data has to represent the same thing.  Tesla&#8217;s comparison would be valid if they had statistics for average cars for the same set of data (driving on divided highways in good weather).  However since the 2 data sets are from vastly different situations the comparison is meaningless.  It would be like saying that a shotgun is &#8220;more accurate&#8221; than a handgun because it hits its target more often.  Since they are often used to fire birdshot, they are more likely to hit the intended target so the comparison doesn&#8217;t make sense.  Same situation when Tesla compares its autopilot data to data from the NHTSA (which encompasses all weather conditions, all types of roads, etc)</p>

It is known the Tesla driver listened to podcasts and audio books, it could have been one of those and no more dangerous than listening to the radio (or it could have been a full video plus audio DVD he was watching, we don&#8217;t really know). Fact is we don&#8217;t know all the facts yet. Still my guess is that whatever the Tesla driver was doing he was not adequately concentrated on the view through the windshield and that sadly is the reason he died, I don&#8217;t care what he was up to except that he was not monitoring his vehicles progress.<br />
I have a Model S and it is true that at first you do tend to be lulled into overconfidence in auto-pilot. But auto-pilot is subject to error, for instance when cresting a rise with the sun not too far above the horizon it can do strange things like dropping the speed of the car as the traffic aware cruise control drops out. Once (only once, that was enough to change my behaviour when it comes to trusting auto-pilot) the car took a violent lunge towards the oncoming traffic but as luck would have it I had my hands on the wheel so I violently turned the wheel away from the approaching vehicles. Of course if I had observed Tesla&#8217;s instructions I would not have used auto-steer on a road without a centre divider in the first place. Anyway I now make sure not to take my hands off the wheel when using auto-steer and I make sure to stay alert for problems. There is nothing like a near death experience to wake up your ideas.</p>

I&#8217;m kind of half joking half serious here.  In any situation where you&#8217;re just checking what someone else is doing or has done, which is basically the case if you&#8217;re driving with autopilot, it&#8217;s almost impossible to stay alert for very long if the person you&#8217;re checking appears not to be making any mistakes.  For example, if checking over someone&#8217;s arithmetic, if they&#8217;ve done 1,000 calculations without error, you&#8217;ll find it almost impossible not to fall half asleep as you keep checking, whereas if they had introduced a deliberate error into say about every 50th calculation, that would keep you alert.</p>

<p>As to the existence of such roads, yes, they are &#8216;a thing.&#8217;  They aren&#8217;t even all that uncommon; there are several fairly near Atlanta, where I live.  The speed limit is generally 55, but most drivers (I would estimate) travel at somewhere between 60-80.</p>

In this case it would not saved the life of the driver, but it would helped the radar of the Tesla to detect the trailer instead of detecting nothing. As always in transport accidents, planes, trains or cars, fatal accidents are not the result of a single thing. Here, we have a perfect storm, with a truck turning and crossing in a highway (we don&#8217;t know for sure if the truck driver didn&#8217;t saw the car because it was coming fast or if he saw it but was impatient and counting that the car will slow down so make the crossing like I saw some trucks doing in front of me and as we can see in lot of youtube videos (mostly in Russia thanks to dash cams be mandatory by insurers) with truck deciding to cross even with car already in the intersection. The perfect storm continue with a, maybe, distracted car driver, with a speed to above the limit?, with autopilot didn&#8217;t recognising the trailer as an obstacle, with the trailer not having the lateral protective metal bars and so on and so on.</p>

Oh no, one person died within 130 THOUSAND miles of driving and use. Insensitive? Sure. But statistically driving with autopilot on is safer than manual driving. Autopilot isn&#8217;t over, it&#8217;s not &#8220;the end of automated driving&#8221; because people die in cars MUCH more often when they&#8217;re in control. It wasn&#8217;t even the driver&#8217;s fault, it was the semi&#8217;s fault. The autopilot still malfunctioned and didn&#8217;t sense it coming, but if the semi hadn&#8217;t pulled out where it did he would still be alive. Including Google&#8217;s self driving cars, the number of crashes that are the autopilot&#8217;s fault is still less than 10. Every other crash is another human&#8217;s fault for running into it. </p>
<p>Again, as insensitive as it sounds&#8230; One death per 130k miles is pretty dang good. This is (I believe) the first death involving a self driving car. I don&#8217;t get why people are so up in arms about this. </p>

<p>There&#8217;s not enough data to make a meaningful statement.  Let&#8217;s say we had 50 billion miles of data that finds one Tesla fatality per 130 million miles.  That could actually mean that the Tesla system is much worse than human drivers.</p>
<p>The fatality rate for human drivers is one per 90 million.  But 90% of human fatalities are due to drinking, distracted driving sorts of stuff.  That means that the fatalities for other reasons(failure to see, bad judgement) might be in the one in 900 million mile range.  At one per 130 million Tesla&#8217;s system could be a massive failure.</p>

<p>Auto-pilot must be able to drive at the same speed as the flow of traffic which is often 10-20 miles above a posted speed limit. It it can&#8217;t, the slow driving car becomes a dangerous hazard.

That&#8217;s a pretty good track record, statistically speaking. </p>

<p>The driver apparently was not watching the road.  Even at high speed one should see a tractor trailer crossing the road in front of you and stop.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like there wasn&#8217;t some warning time.  The tractor part of the rig had (apparently) already cleared the lane.  18-wheelers don&#8217;t have rocket speed acceleration.</p>
<p>Based on what is known at this time I think the Tesla driver owns most of the responsibility.  It seems that he decided to speed, he did not keep his eyes on the road.</p>
<p>Truck driver may be partly to blame.  Tesla driver may be mostly to blame.  Tesla collision avoidance system needs improvement.</p>

<p>After seeing all the warnings about Autopilot, I don&#8217;t see the point.  To use it SAFELY, you may as well be driving yourself. (Not that this won&#8217;t change &#8212; but it will almost certainly take years).</p>

How they get that number is unclear to me. Looking up what Wikipedia has to say about autopilot, fwiw,  I notice a few things- high reliance on redundant but different software systems ( up to 5 for space craft ) and still limited true autopilot on commercial aircraft. The software is hard to create. I&#8217;m a software engineer, and have used Polyspace Code Prover ( google it ) on embedded medical device software. It is also used in the automotive field.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-412057" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>What I was floored by, via investigating Youtube after reading about this incident, is thee are a lot of people driving on autopilot in areas FAR more dangerous than this &#8212; and not being very careful (or careful at all in some cases). </p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking busy 4 and 6 lane undivided highways, curbs, pedestrians, traffic lights, curves, merging and exits, etc. I&#8217;m talking drivers turning to look BACK at the camera mounted in the rear of the car, while the car drives itself &#8212; on a crowded highway.  I&#8217;m talking hands in laps or waving around, feet away from the pedals, and 90%+ of the drivers&#8217; attention on the video they&#8217;re making instead of the road, because they feel &#8220;safe&#8221; with Autopilot at that time. </p>
<p>If Tesla doesn&#8217;t investigate what is going on (which is easy enough to find) and take this out of the beta testing mode, or do some serious geo-fencing as per your good suggestion, they are asking for some serious problems until the system is truly fully certified road ready for full autonomy.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-411901" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>It depends on the amount of time between the truck turning and the impact.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing that the Tesla&#8217;s collision avoidance system did not detect the truck, the car continued to drive at high speed after having its top sheared off.  Had the system detected the  trailer then the brakes would have come on and stopped the car.  </p>
<p>The truck driver is apparently (I&#8217;m waiting for official information) partially responsible for the accident.  He seems to have made an illegal turn across the lane.  (But perhaps he didn&#8217;t.  We don&#8217;t actually know.)</p>
<p>But just because someone does something illegal does not give you the right to crash into them.  The driver of the blocked car should taken evasive action.  Smashed his foot down on the brake pedal, at the very least.  Had the Tesla driver done his job there would be skid marks leading up to the  point of impact.  Stepping on the brake would have turned off cruise control and the car would have slowed to a stop rather than continuing to drive well past the point of impact.</p>
<p>A very large part of the blame seems to belong to the Tesla driver.  He apparently did not do his job of observing the road.   It looks like he didn&#8217;t realize there was a problem until the windshield caved in.</p>
<p>Does Tesla deserve some of the blame?  I haven&#8217;t been able to decide that for myself.  </p>
<p>Tesla released an incomplete (beta) system but they warned owners that it was not ready to drive the car all by itself and drivers should continue to be alert and ready to take back control.  I think that through and I assign Tesla no blame.</p>
<p>But Tesla should have known, especially after seeing people do dumb stuff like sit in the back seat while their Tesla &#8216;auto-piloted&#8217; that the potential for abuse was significant.  Perhaps at that point they should have clawed back the system.  Perhaps limiting it to stop and go, traffic jam driving conditions and gradually allowing higher speed driving as they gathered more data on their collision avoidance system.  So then I lay some of the blame at Tesla&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I think Tesla should do right now.  Limit lane keeping to low (very low probability of serious injury) speeds.  Collect a hell of a lot more data on the collision avoidance system.</p>

<p>Would the same have happened had a human been driving?  I don&#8217;t think so.  The human would have seen the tractor, at least the black wheels, cross the lane and the wheels of the trailer and hit the brakes.</p>

We don&#8217;t know because we don&#8217;t know the length of time between the front end of the tractor entering the lane and the moment of impact.

Maybe it can with enough radar beams in place and enough resolution, but the system obviously isn&#8217;t yet that capable.  I suspect the car is basically casting radar straight out the nose and perfectly level to the ground and only responds with braking when it sees something significantly close because otherwise a road that curves upwards would be seen as a distant obstacle worthy of braking for.</p>

<p>From 200 feet away it should be obvious that there is something in front of the car and brakes should have been applied.  That might not have been soon enough to save the driver, but the car should not have continued on a long distance past the crash.</p>

We&#8217;ve now seen two cases where an autopilot car ran its windshield into a low object (the second case being while auto park was engaged), and the manual even warns that the car may not see things hanging from a ceiling during auto park.  I&#8217;m sure this lack of hardware is what Elon was hinting at when he said they would need hardware upgrades to allow fully autonomous driving without human intervention.  Unfortunately, some drivers are clearly treating this iteration of the system as fully autonomous and not paying attention to the road after they&#8217;ve grown to trust the car.  This death will be a wake up call to autopilot users for awhile, but I suspect we&#8217;ll see this happen again eventually if Tesla doesn&#8217;t somehow track if a driver is paying attention to the road and disable autopilot if not.</p>

This article says the car remained on auto pilot after going off road, auto pilot swerved to avoid some trees, then failed to swerve when it hit a power pole&#8230;  All that suggests a catastrophic failure of autopilot logic, but I don&#8217;t know what evidence there is that autopilot remained active after the roof was torn off.  The camera for auto pilot is located where the mirror attaches to the windshield glass.  That camera would have been torn off in the crash, so I can&#8217;t imagine auto pilot could have remained active at that point.</p>

The car struck around the middle of the semi trailer.  Those trucks move very slowly while making a turn or while starting from a full stop.  It would take at least 5 seconds (probably much more) for the truck to get far enough across the highway that you would hit the middle of the trailer.  5 seconds is a long time for an attentive driver to notice something gigantic moving across the highway.  Therefore, no driver paying any amount of attention to the road would have had this accident.  Certainly not without trying to brake or trying to swerve to avoid the trailer.  At 3:40pm with the sun behind the driver, there was no way the truck was not highly visible to human vision, &#8220;bright&#8221; sky or not.</p>

Note that Autopilot is limited to 5mph above the posted speed limit. The car wasn&#8217;t speeding. Not unless it was under full manual control &#8211; and apparently it was operating under Autipilot. That rules out speeding.</p>
<p>While it might seem attractive to make this topic all about Autopilot, what actually happened is that a truck pulled out directly in front of a car that was operating legally and had priority over the truck. The truck was crossing a main road and was obliged to wait for onoming traffic to pass.</p>
<p>Ordinary there was plenty of visbility for the truck driver to see the Tesla and to wait for it to pass before pulling out &#8211; except we are told that the truck driver was staring into sunlight sufficient that the reflection from the side of his truck was as bright as the sky.</p>
<p>Yes the family should sue. They should sue the truck driver and or his insurer. </p>
<p>There is nothing here to suggest that Autopilot is at fault. It might be possible to upgrade Autopilot to save the day in future. Gut feel &#8211; even if the Radar had identified this obstruction as too close to the ground to pass under, there would not have been time enough to avoid impact due to the actions of the Truck Driver pulling directly across a Highway infront a car travelling at Highway speeds. </p>
<p>When this story finally settles, I suspect the simple truth is that the truck driver was blinded by sunlight and took a chance that nothing was coming &#8211; and got it fatally wrong.</p>

<p>We do not know how much time elapsed between the truck entering the lane and the impact.  Since the cab had cleared the lane there would have been adequate time for a human driver to take some sort of preventative action.  (Not saying that there was enough time to avoid some sort of contact, we don&#8217;t have enough information.)</p>
<p>Think this through.  You&#8217;re driving down the road with your cruise control set no more than 5 MPG above the speed limit.</p>
<p>A tractor trailer leaves the left hand turn lane on the opposite side, goes through the median, and pulls into your lane.  The Sun is behind you (that was the case?).  An 18-wheeler tractor is big.  If you were paying attention you would see it.  If you weren&#8217;t brain dead you would at least slow down (tap the brake and turn off the cruise control).  And if you realized that you were likely to hit the trailer then you&#8217;d slam on the brake.   </p>
<p>The collision avoidance system seems to have done nothing.</p>

<p>I think it is backwards to criticise the Autopilot. This accident was the full fault of the truck driver. The truck driver was negligent and broke the law and the Tesla had the full right to pass unmolested and without concern or need to take evasive action.</p>
<p>The fact that some tweek to Autopilot might be able to save the day in future is a bonus, not a cause.</p>
<p>Driver distraction by Autopilot is also a nonsense. I have travelled with Americans on long (1000 mile plus)  journeys watching DVDs in a Ford F-150 and the world is full of people texting from the driver&#8217;s seat. The fact that autopilot can prevent most of these getting into trouble is basically vital. </p>

<p>100% agree.  Akin to traffic on a cloverleaf on ramp. &#8230;..one tracks it while figuring should I move from the right lane to the center lane OR should I move out of the center lane into the left lane so the chap in the right lane can move over to allow the new vehicle to enter to road&#8230;&#8230;Yada Yada yada&#8230;.</p>

The same thing has happened believe it or not, when people thought cruise control autopilot meant you could go to sleep or do something else.<br />
The point is, we are relying on tech to solve the problem, but it&#8217;s not completely a tech problem. It is well known that users must drive normally controlling the car and that the features are an assist. But the technology is too tempting to use in ways it was not yet legally sanctioned. But if it&#8217;s there, people will use it.<br />
The technology has the potential to save lives, but can be abused. Autopilot is used by airline pilots every day, but we still have pilots and they still control the plane on takeoff and landing and pilots must be in control during level flight at all times. Technology can do many things, but it cannot fix human behavior.<br />
Ultimately, we are responsible. IMO, during the adoption phase, we cannot allow autonomous driving with beta mode software. This is the car industry, not PCs. The stakes are too high. Even if the software is blameless, in automotive, the design standard is to have deep levels of safety back up and conservative design.<br />
We also cannot rely on simple hands on wheel detectors that won&#8217;t stop users from blocking vision. Seat belts were despised by some when new, but are now accepted daily behavior. The same struggle goes on trying to get people to use them. Technology can&#8217;t fix everything. Will we make cars drive the speed limit? Will we have it detect impaired driving? These things have potential, but in the end we have to adapt to technology as much as it adapts to our habits and behaviors. The real answer is that we must explore and examine ourselves much more. A tragedy like this is a time for us to pause, give condolences, and consider our lives and those around us.</p>

That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t completely trust autopilot. When computers are so good that that kind of thing never happens, then and only then, can we trust autonomous driving explicitly. You have to be able to override the system and you must be able to control it at all times. It should be an assist only, not a substitute for the driver. But how to do that so that no one defeats the system or relies on it too much?</p>

The Jury awarded the woman the equivalent of 2 days worth of coffee sales at McDonalds, equalling 2.7 milion dollars. They did so because McDonald&#8217;s had already  had 700 people who had been burned by their 195 degree coffee. Even after their own safety officer suggested that 155 degrees  coffee would stop people from getting 3rd degree burns within 2-7 seconds as 180+ degree coffee does. It took 700 people being scarred and disfigured before McDonalds was forced to serve their coffee at a cooler and consumable temperature. Look it up.

<p>In the real world, how likely is it that all (or even most) drivers are going to carefully review the entire owner&#8217;s manual, and are going to catch every single warning about Autopilot? </p>
<p>Since the fatal accident, I&#8217;ve watched a number of online videos of drivers using autopilot, not looking at the road, not keeping their hands anywhere near the wheel, not keeping their feet near the pedals, and acting as though the Autopilot was completely reliable.</p>
<p>I saw MANY spots in several videos where the Autopilot got confused and would have caused a wreck if the driver hadn&#8217;t intervened.  (Most of these were with drivers who were well aware of the system&#8217;s limitations, and were explaining that the driver had to stay alert and ready to take over). </p>
<p>I still have a big problem with releasing a system in BETA to the general public driving on public roads.  Driving isn&#8217;t a video game.</p>

Normally if you nod off at the wheel accidentally your head falls forward and you wake up.  If he intentionally wanted to sleep he would have leaned the seat back.  Instead, his head was at a pretty uncomfortable angle which made for a good photo, but not a realistic position to nod off accidentally.  I could believe a guy going into the back seat was a similarly staged situation.  If not, he deserves a Darwin award.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been on the shoulder several times and in the ditch a couple from people driving in the middle of a narrow two lane road while coming around a curve.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done panic braking because someone was messing with their smart phone and pulled out in front of me after they had stopped at a stop sign.</p>
